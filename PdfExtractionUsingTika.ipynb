      "2. OBJECTIVES OF THE PARTNERSHIP\r\n",
      "2.1 Presentation of the issue(s)\r\n",
      "Culture and cultural heritage is everywhere. It permeates all spaces and places in cities and regions and is part of our daily life. It reaches out well beyond museums, heritage sites or traditional cultural institutions. It can be found in technology hubs, in media clusters to nourish innovation, on city walls (graffiti and murals), in community centres and at street festivals that trigger social interactions.\r\n",
      "Culture and cultural heritage serve to create an atmosphere and ultimately shape the attractiveness of places. Cultural initiatives have become one of the main agents for change in society. Cultural investment and cultural workers influence the spirit and morale of people and foster the attractiveness of cities and regions. EU, national, regional and local policies and investments in culture and cultural heritage actively contribute to social cohesion, employment and entrepreneurship, as well as the wellbeing of European societies. A systematic, integrated approach that uses culture and cultural heritage as a pillar for urban development is required in order to make full use of the social, ecological and economic resources of our urban areas, as well as their potential.\r\n",
      "Culture and cultural heritage, as a tangible testimony of historical sedimentation in cities and civilisations, has been recognised as an important topic for the EU. The year 2018 was dedicated especially to this subject: ‘The aim of the European Year of Cultural Heritage is to encourage more people to discover and engage with Europe's cultural heritage and to reinforce a sense of belonging to a common European space’.\r\n",
      "Starting from this understanding, the Partnership on Culture and Cultural Heritage in the specific framework of the Urban Agenda for the EU will mainly identify actions necessary to tackle the problems met by cities during their implementation of projects relating to the protection, promotion and creation of cultural heritage as a mean for sound, sustainable and qualitative urban processes.\r\n",
      "Furthermore, the Partnership intends to analyse the role of culture and cultural services in the development of more inclusive and cohesive cities.\r\n",
      "The definition of ‘urban cultural heritage’ may vary according to the scale of the survey, ranging from a manufacture, a single monument or a single museum, to an urban landscape or the urban fabric as a whole (i.e. historical centres), or a net of monuments and museums. The definition may also vary according to the interests of the researchers and, in this framework, the definition of ‘cultural heritage’ has to include also all the immaterial and intangible heritage, such as local know-how, the creative sectors, specific production capacity, etc.\r\n",
      "The physical as well as the intangible elements of cultural heritage become the cornerstone of the overall project to regenerate urban identity. Enhancing cultural heritage is actually a means to promote sound, long-term, sustainable, local urban development.\r\n",
      "Preserving the quality of landscapes and built environment heritage is not an end in itself, but is a powerful tool to achieve social, ecological and economic goals. This awareness incorporates the knowledge that the high quality of natural and built heritage contributes to the formation of sustainable societies, which are characterised by a high quality of life, cultural diversity, good individual and community well-being, social equity and cohesion, and a strong economic performance. Broadening the thematic understanding of the European city is essential for the correct management of cultural heritage.\r\n",
      "With this perspective, the field of actions to enhance urban cultural heritage extends towards the integration of the environment, tourism and recreational activities, actively interacting with interventions aimed at promoting the city.\r\n",
      "The cities and towns of Europe should be viewed as cultural resources requiring preservation and further development. Their potential for sustainable development in line with the Urban Agenda has ecological, economic and social relevance. Against this background, the Partnership on Culture and Cultural Heritage intends to focus on these three key issues, taking into account interdependencies -– such as multilevel governance - and formulating results with reference to the three pillars of better regulation, better funding and better knowledge.\r\n",
      "The cross-cutting issue mentioned in the Pact of Amsterdam related to the New Urban Agenda (HABITAT III) will also be taken into account.\r\n",
      "In this case, drivers for actions on urban culture and heritage presented by UN- HABITAT in Quito included the following:\r\n",
      "· Fostering a territorial approach to urban development through culture-based\r\n",
      "strategic planning;\r\n",
      "· Learning from innovative practices in historic areas to plan more compact cities based on mixed urban development;\r\n",
      "· Stimulating urban regeneration through cultural and creative sectors, events\r\n",
      "and institutions;\r\n",
      "· Improving the quality of, and access to, public spaces through culture;\r\n",
      "· Increasing the culture-led competitiveness of cities through investments in cultural infrastructure and sectors, capacity-building programmes and new technologies;\r\n",
      "· Fostering sustainable cultural tourism to the benefit of local communities and individuals, to encourage the renewal and revival of cultural heritage;\r\n",
      "· Building on culture as a factor of identity and dialogue among communities for education and social cohesion, and in the fight against inequalities;\r\n",
      "· Ensuring cultural rights for all and respect for cultural diversity to promote inclusive cities;\r\n",
      "· Putting culture at the core of urban resilience strategies;\r\n",
      "· Developing follow-up tools and indicators to assess and quantify the contribution of culture to urban development.\r\n",
      "Last but not least, it is also important to highlight that if looking at urban cultural heritage on a global scale, it is easy to see a common European identity. There are common topics at the European level that show our common history and approaches in this context.\r\n",
      "Starting from these common concepts (see also paragraph 2.1.5 on the Urban Governance), we can further develop a common understanding and a common framework that will better foster the implementation of appropriate actions in this field.\r\n",
      "2.1.1 Culture and cultural heritage as a resource and potential for urban development\r\n",
      "European cities and municipalities perform a balancing act: urbanisation, depopulation, migration, demographic change, climate change, increasing mobility and growing tourism – these are just a few of the issues that have a far-reaching impact on the city as a human habitat. The consequent changes/transformations in urban areas have a direct impact on the natural and built environment heritage. As a consequence, Europe is now experiencing a general decline in the quality of the built environment and open landscapes in urban and peri-urban spaces. These aspects affect the sense of belonging to an area and decrease the positive attitude towards all political levels and the EU.\r\n",
      "In this context, preserving the quality of the landscape and the built environment, heritage is not an objective in itself, but it is rather a powerful tool aimed at achieving social, ecological and economic goals. Enhancing the relevance of culture in European cities and settlements and creating and/or preserving the quality of culture and cultural heritage at local level (in the centre or peri-urban settlements), is actually a means to promote sound, long-term, sustainable, local urban development.\r\n",
      "Greater awareness of specific cultural identities and cultural heritage in human settlements is to be considered as a priority at the local and European level in order to develop new ways to protect and promote our common cultural values and identities.\r\n",
      "This awareness brings about the knowledge that the high quality of the natural and built heritage contributes to the formation of more sustainable and inclusive societies, respectful of cultural diversity, to social equity and cohesion, individual and community well-being, and – last but not least – to a stronger economic performance and higher quality of life.\r\n",
      "A systematic, integrated approach that uses the definition of culture and cultural heritage as a starting point is required in order to make full use of the social, ecological and economic resources as well as the potential of our urban areas. This includes physical, tangible heritage (such as buildings protected by law, meaningful urban structures, significant urban landscapes, etc.) as well as intangible heritage such as local know-how and cultural identities.\r\n",
      "Cities and towns in Europe should be viewed as cultural resources that require preservation and further development (with the key issues of conservation, demolition and development). Their potential for sustainable development, in line with the Urban Agenda, has ecological, economic and social relevance.\r\n",
      "2.1.2 Cultural heritage as an ecological resource\r\n",
      "The ecological aspect takes the urban fabric, the landscape and the physical morphology of an urban area into consideration. Here, the recognition of the relevance of these aspects is strategic to promote green/brown reconversion of\r\n",
      "urban sites; the suitable rehabilitation of run-down neighbourhoods; the appropriate relationship between urban areas and their rural and peri-urban surroundings; and a new social pact for civil cohabitation with the objective of recognising - promoting or creating the identities of the urban milieux1.\r\n",
      "The capacity to strengthen the value of the natural heritage within urban areas, without setting off gentrification mechanisms, is still challenging. Participatory processes to foster the ecological requalification of urban spaces are still fragmented. In addition, sound and integrated operations to (re)create natural urban ecological areas are expensive and experimental.\r\n",
      "These operations need resources and the mobilisation of all the actors involved. Moreover, while the rehabilitation of the historical urban fabric of a city is recognised as a proven and ‘safe’ process, the requalification of suburban areas (to enhance the quality of their natural open spaces) still presents some challenges (finance is a political process, and historical neighbourhoods are funded more easily in comparison to peripheral areas).\r\n",
      "Natural open spaces can be transformed and/or rehabilitated to enhance the quality of an area and to foster its identity. In the framework of the Partnership, it will be strategic to investigate the appropriate elements and tools that allow urban authorities to interpret natural open spaces and all the resulting open spaces as an opportunity. Developing these spaces as part of an ‘urban ecological network’ and creating identity-making areas can significantly increase both the ecological response and the resilience of those urban areas, as well as their social inclusion and economic development.\r\n",
      "On a building scale, it is now recognised that material and energy resources have gone into both the buildings and infrastructure of our cities, and it is important to use these for as long as possible. This is why the preservation and further development of existing building stock is the starting point for future-proof urban development.\r\n",
      "Smart use of existing resources makes a significant contribution to the achievement of national, European and global sustainability goals. In the framework of the Partnership, it will be important to examine existing actions to assess what makes them successful and which barriers are present, in order to develop options for improvement and to consider their feasibility in multilevel systems.\r\n",
      "Key issues here include the following:\r\n",
      "· To investigate and promote how participatory approaches can enhance processes of natural heritage rehabilitation without gentrification in order to facilitate those positive processes (e.g. better legislation and better funding).\r\n",
      "1 The definition of the French term of milieu is well explained through the Latin term “genius loci” (Cfr “genius Loci” Christian Normen Schulz)\r\n",
      "· To increase awareness of the positive direct relationship between the quality of the natural urban heritage and sustainable economic development. There is a direct link between the quality of the natural urban fabric and the long-term economic development of an area (see the case of the Tuscany Region vis-à- vis others) that is yet to be fully understood (i.e. better knowledge is required).\r\n",
      "· To recognise the importance of the multi-sectoral approach in terms of urban rehabilitation planning. Creating green open spaces and green infrastructures can at the same time increase the quality and identity of an area, enhance its capacity for resilience, ensure better sustainable mobility systems and services to citizens, etc. (i.e. better knowledge and better funding).\r\n",
      "· To investigate how to create effective networks among sites of cultural importance (i.e. to enhance the cultural heritage of small and medium-sized cities that are linked to cities of global importance).\r\n",
      "· To legitimise the demolition and reuse of buildings and urban infrastructure materials as well as the reuse of underused/abandoned building stock to foster the circular economy approach.\r\n",
      "· To ensure the energy certification of the whole municipality, urban sub-regions (neighbourhoods), building groups and individual buildings.\r\n",
      "· To develop innovative mobility solutions by pooling urban functions in close proximity, using and taking into account existing building stock and infrastructure.\r\n",
      "2.1.3 Cultural heritage as an economic resource\r\n",
      "Urban heritage is ‘the historical stratification of cultural and natural values, which extends beyond the notion of “historical centre” or “ensemble” to include the broader urban context and its geographical location’ (UNESCO, 2011). As a result, it is recommended to use a landscape approach based on the recognition of the value system of urban heritage and a management of urban changes that is respectful of heritage and its value.\r\n",
      "The UNESCO recommendation represents a fundamental moment of reflection in the search for a new approach to the management of cities and their heritage (tangible and intangible), the involvement of local actors, the integration between disciplinary sectors and the promotion of a model of sustainable socio-economic development.\r\n",
      "In this context, the role of urban cultural heritage as an economic resource for local development should be considered an essential resource for civil cohabitation and the well-being of citizens in order to support the economic growth of the community. These aspects take into consideration all the intangible assets of culture and should be investigated in order to promote the feeling of belonging and social cohesion as a means to take care of one’s own environment and to create economic opportunities.\r\n",
      "Creativity and smart specialisation based on the enhancement of local know-how increase collaborative approaches in order to develop products, accelerate markets, identify synergies, and widen and expand industrial interest in private investments. Therefore, creativity and smart specialisation may help to build open, inclusive and pluralistic societies based on knowledge.\r\n",
      "In terms of existing stocks, it is now clear how investments in this sector make a great contribution in terms of local and regional value creation. They are also characterised by long-lasting value retention, making this an optimal use for both public and private funds.\r\n",
      "Key issues here include:\r\n",
      "· how the smart specialisation of local areas and innovation based on local capacities can have a positive impact on territorial heritage development;\r\n",
      "· how the governance of cultural heritage can foster the economic development of an area;\r\n",
      "· the conversion potential of public infrastructure and other structures (e.g.\r\n",
      "cultural programme, creative sector, affordable housing);\r\n",
      "· the possibilities for pooling functions and for short-, medium- and long-term added value through public or private owners;\r\n",
      "· the increase in employment options via the quality-oriented management of cultural heritage, the rehabilitation of historical buildings, the incentive to sustain local traditional arts and crafts, etc.;\r\n",
      "· the relevance of cultural heritage in terms of branding, strengthening locations and relocation projects;\r\n",
      "· the avoidance of displacement processes and the formation of monofunctional neighbourhoods, in particular due to tourism or other business approaches;\r\n",
      "· the local link between the creation of added value and activities related to\r\n",
      "qualifications and long-lasting education;\r\n",
      "· the material and immaterial support requirements for landowners, investors, project developers and city-users in order for them to become positive drivers behind sustainable investment decisions.\r\n",
      "2.1.4 Cultural heritage as a social resource\r\n",
      "Over the course of history and today, the cultural heritage of cities has been relevant for processes of social change. People identify with the cultural heritage of a city, not only those citizens living there, but Europeans in general (e.g. the European movement created by important artists and citizen to protect Victor Horta’s Maison du Peuple in Brussels or Les Halles in Paris from speculative demolition in the last century).\r\n",
      "Public cultural heritage management and the condition of historical neighbourhoods affect the sense of belonging and affection of citizens for their local representatives of the State. Besides, the capacity of the management of the cultural heritage and its condition (if referred to the tangible ones) or its quality (if referred to the intangible ones, such as the offer of cultural events) is directly linked to individuals’ sense of place and belonging. This also leads to respect for public spaces and therefore has an impact on security, criminality, brutalist behaviour, etc.\r\n",
      "As a result, it is increasingly important to enable processes where citizens can inform public authorities about urban sites (both buildings or open spaces) that are unused or abandoned, but that constitute a common value for them, for a specific community or for the identity of the neighbourhood.\r\n",
      "The capacity for urban public authorities to enable such processes is not easy. Ongoing practices vary greatly and are still fragmented. Nevertheless, such processes allow for new cultural heritage sites to be promoted: not only those sites that are already recognised and listed, but also those that are of importance to a specific area and/or a community. In so doing, these processes can create new forms of social and economic opportunities for the sustainable development of local areas.\r\n",
      "Key issues here include the following:\r\n",
      "· the re-appropriation of urban spaces (such as the rehabilitation of abandoned urban sites) recognised as ‘common goods’, including a means for inhabitants to foster the identity of a place and to increase its quality (which also means taking care of the place and its security);\r\n",
      "· the increased capacity for public authorities to handle bottom-up approaches for the management of cultural heritage, which means:\r\n",
      "· capacity to listen to project requests (client-driven approach);\r\n",
      "· capacity to act through multi-sector initiatives (work by objectives to be reached and not by sectoral competences to perform);\r\n",
      "· capacity to create a new form of economic and social opportunities.\r\n",
      "· the relevance and effectiveness of temporally staggered cycles of renewal for sustainable social relations;\r\n",
      "· the requirements for the modern management of culturally valuable urban\r\n",
      "areas, green spaces and recreational areas;\r\n",
      "· the management of cultural heritage in order to increase the quality of life and the standard of living;\r\n",
      "· the possibility to test out and anchor participatory processes in urban society;\r\n",
      "· bottom-up involvement in neighbourhood development in order to rehabilitate cultural heritage sites (taking into account pro- and anti-development framework conditions and factors).\r\n",
      "2.1.5 Cultural heritage as a governance and planning resource\r\n",
      "Planning is not just a technical tool, but also a political issue (it may create or avoid social conflicts; it may lead to gentrification, etc.). Due to 2018 being the European Year of Cultural Heritage and other projects (such as Horizon 2020), Members States are now discussing the importance of the quality of the built environment (e.g. redefining European criteria for cultural heritage interventions; fostering adaptive reuse, capacity building and financial mechanisms to ensure the quality of spaces) and exploring the relevance of planning processes.\r\n",
      "Despite each urban area in the world having its own character, there is a common European approach to urban transformation: the role of the public sector and the relevance of urban planning, regulatory tools and soft instruments are common elements at the European level. Among these common approaches, we can mention:\r\n",
      "· the role of the public in the planning management of urban/territorial changes;\r\n",
      "· the presence of public sectors and public welfare;\r\n",
      "· the expectation of citizens from public sectors and the state;\r\n",
      "· the share of common social and cultural principles; and\r\n",
      "· the attention paid to historical places and to the milieu.\r\n",

      "A seventh topic on ‘Cultural services and culture for inclusive cities’ was added following the proposal of the City of Berlin.\r\n",
      "The seven topics are the following:\r\n",
      "1. Cultural tourism;\r\n",
      "4. Creative and cultural sectors;\r\n",
      "5. Transformation, adaptive reuse and urban reconversion;\r\n",
      "6. Financial sustainability and funding;\r\n",
      "7. Resilience of cultural and natural heritage;\r\n",
      "8. Integrated and interdisciplinary approaches for governance;\r\n",
      "9. Cultural services and culture for inclusive cities.\r\n",
      "TOPIC 1 - CULTURAL TOURISM\r\n",
      "Key issues\r\n",
      "This key issue is about the need to promote sustainable tourism that brings benefits to communities and cities, while respecting the needs of the local population and ensuring the sustainability of the cultural heritage.\r\n",
      "Cities therefore need to become ‘smart destinations’ of a sustainable tourism approach; in other words, to become a smart destination of a ‘tourism that meets the needs of travellers and inhabitants and, at the same time, protects and improves opportunities for the future of the sites (Cfr. the definition of the World Tourism Organization, UNWTO).\r\n",
      "As a result, one of the main challenges is working on methods and tools ‘to balance touristic flows between major touristic hubs and less visited sites and cities’.\r\n",
      "The Partnership identified the following key issues on the topic of cultural tourism:\r\n",
      "· Overcrowded destinations versus under-exploited destinations.\r\n",
      "· New spread phenomena of the sharing economy (such as Airbnbs) and the consequent gentrification and desertification of the historical centres.\r\n",
      "· Risks for cultural and natural heritage, inconveniences for tourists and the impact on local communities. The congestion of tourist flows exposes cultural and natural assets to conservation and protection issues and risks compromising both the residents’ quality of life and the experience of tourists.\r\n",
      "· Spatial and seasonal imbalances in tourism and cultural demand. The growth of tourism and, in particular, of the demand for cultural heritage – as well as its concentration in some periods of the year and/or of the day – increases the pressure on the most popular and fragile cultural and natural sites and attractions and exposes the urban fabric to the risk of “touristification” and gentrification.\r\n",
      "· Governance issues: lack of multi-level, multi-stakeholder governance\r\n",
      "frameworks enabling shared decision-making among relevant areas such as cultural and natural heritage preservation, spatial planning, tourism management, mobility, infrastructures and the involvement of civil society organisations.\r\n",
      "· Issues related to funding sources and support tools. Funding programmes and\r\n",
      "support tools often pose issues in terms of limited budget, inadequate functioning models and difficult access for beneficiaries.\r\n",
      "· Deficiencies in services and facilities for mobility and the reception of tourists.\r\n",
      "These issues relate to public transport, congestion in historic centres connections with lesser-known destinations in suburban and neighbouring areas, and reception and orientation services for tourists.\r\n",
      "Challenges and key objectives\r\n",
      "Two main challenges emerged during the discussion on the topic of tourism, which led to the establishment of two key challenges:\r\n",
      "1. How to attract more tourists in small/slow cities to contribute to their development;\r\n",
      "10. How to disperse and manage tourism flows that put pressure on overcrowded cities.\r\n",
      "The two challenges could be seen as two sides of the same coin, which require policies on how to balance touristic flows between major touristic hubs and less visited sites and cities.\r\n",
      "Other challenges:\r\n",
      "a. To manage tourist flows by re-discovering the hidden/unknown heritage with respect to the territory and beyond non-traditional destinations and enhancing culture in the wider sense also through the use of technology (thus allowing a better use of the space and time). Objectives: to identify multiplying opportunities and territorial balancing; to ensure that tourists receive a higher quality experience; to enhance the image of the cities as a smart destination.\r\n",
      "b. Informal reception facilities increase the availability of temporary accommodation, but they are often beyond the control and planning of time and space and take away residential places from residents. Objectives: to avoid gentrification and promote a sense of belonging; to identify how to best welcome tourists both in terms of enhancing places and respecting their inhabitants; to achieve an equilibrium between the needs of citizens/inhabitants and travellers/visitors.\r\n",
      "To address these challenges, the following approaches were considered important by the Partnership:\r\n",
      "· Creating a diversification approach to manage visitor flows more effectively. This approach could also be supported by establishing alliances between smaller and larger cities to facilitate and better control tourism flows by, among others:\r\n",
      "· increasing or decreasing tourism tax for hotels and Airbnbs2;\r\n",
      "· presenting an integrated and diversified offer and guidance to tourists;\r\n",
      "· investing in events, areas or activities to attract tourists to smaller cities or areas outside the city centre and the smart use of city data to assess tourism flows.\r\n",
      "· Raising awareness among people about the rich offers often available beyond\r\n",
      "the traditional city centres through digital apps, websites, etc. or through culture passes/cards that provide access to a balanced culture offering and transport solutions that bring visitors to them. This would help tourists to better organise their visits and could help cities to disperse tourist flows.\r\n",
      "· Activating other networks in order to develop less visited sites (e.g.\r\n",
      "recent/contemporary architectural heritage sites). Possible actions include developing European cultural routes oriented towards other topics like century-\r\n",
      "2 Synergies will be sought with the other Urban Agenda for the EU Partnership dealing with the same issue from a different point of view (i.e. housing) in the clustering process.\r\n",
      "specific architecture (e.g. post-WWII reconstruction or mass housing, both part of Europe’s recent history).\r\n",
      "· Developing an integrated planning approach to counteract gentrification. As an\r\n",
      "example, the city of Florence built social housing in the historical city centre creating also different types of services in other to avoid the ghetto effect and having a balanced mixitè-sociale (Cfr. see the project of “Firenze Murate”).\r\n",
      "· Fostering innovative3 and more prepared tourist guides.\r\n",
      "· Counteracting mobility and accessibility issues for tourist destinations in a sustainable way.\r\n",
      "· Ensuring a sustainable and responsible way to manage tourism in the long- term, by using all available territorial assets and resources. This could entail the creation of European common rules to define sustainable tourism.\r\n",
      "· Boosting and improving the relationship between tourists and inhabitants by preserving the ‘liveability’ of an area (e.g. regulation to preserve local crafts and promotion that seeks to attract certain types of tourists4).\r\n",
      "· Preserving the identity of small areas, especially UNESCO centres and the ‘spirit’ of a cultural heritage site by regulating access and the types of businesses that are located on the site. The objective is also to prevent a monoculture of shop types: as an example, fostering networks among ‘other’ museums such as eco-museums, community-based museums, ethnic museums or local histories usually important for local communities and less visible on the mainstream tourist flows).\r\n",
      "· Working together with UNESCO and other Partnerships on this theme.\r\n",
      "· Taking into consideration the work done by DG EAC as part of the initiative ‘Promoting sustainable cultural tourism’. This initiative was among ten EU initiatives launched for the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018 along with, among others, an EU Member State expert group on Sustainable Cultural Tourism that has already published recommendations (DG EAC).\r\n",
      "· Safeguarding and preserving urban cultural and natural heritage as well as local authenticity. This includes ensuring the protection of historical sites, city centres and cultural and natural heritage and preserving the local identity and intangible elements (e.g. craftsmanship, know-how, traditions, lifestyle).\r\n",
      "· Enhancing and differentiating between tourist offers. Mitigating the seasonality of tourism demand and promoting the time-based dispersal of visitors towards lesser known destinations and less congested routes and sites.\r\n",
      "· Reusing abandoned and disused buildings and areas in order to make spaces available for cultural events, creative sectors, social activities and tourist enjoyment (see also the topic related to the transformation and adaptive use of the city).\r\n",
      "· Improving the quality of tourist services while keeping urban spaces liveable for residents. Increasing the quality of tourist reception services and designing public services and amenities for both residents and visitors.\r\n",
      "3 For example, the “angeli del turista” (tourist angel) created in the city of Naples. The angels bring tourists to see unconventional places explaining the real side of the city in a secure and safe manner. A similar project was invented in Rio de Janero, where an NGO bring tourists to see the informal neighbourhood of the Rosigna (a favela in Rio).\r\n",
      "4 Synergies could be sought with the projects to be funded under the call ‘Transforming historic urban areas and/or cultural landscapes into hubs of entrepreneurship and social and cultural integration’.\r\n",
      "· Developing effective governance frameworks, long-term visions and evidence- based policies. Promoting governance frameworks that enable shared decision- making among all relevant policy sectors and the participation of stakeholders and civil society representatives (aimed at developing strategic planning and at fixing medium- and long-term goals). Promoting evidence-based policy-making through the increased timely availability of tourism-related data.\r\n",
      "· Ensuring the well-being of local communities. Involving residents in participatory processes to ensure that their needs are listened to and to allow them to play a role in local decision-making. Promoting the environmental, economic and social sustainability of tourism as a resource for an inclusive economy and social development to provide equitable benefits to communities and individuals.\r\n",
      "· Developing a dialogue between public authorities and major tourism players and a dedicated regulatory framework in order to ensure the development of a sustainable tourism model.\r\n",
      "· Fostering cross-border and inter-regional cooperation aimed at promoting cultural and thematic routes that focus on cultural and natural heritage and valorise recognised European sites (such as those awarded the European Heritage Label or included within certified Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe). Promoting opportunities for meaningful exchanges between tourists interested in authentic cultural experiences and local residents, focusing, for example, on intangible cultural heritage.\r\n",
      "Possible actions\r\n",
      "Reconciling the tourist flow with the requirements of protection of the territory also in terms of the consumption of resources and waste production, in an ecosystem that necessarily involves (since the beginning, in the planning phase) all interested stakeholders (i.e. associations, private sectors, NGOs, ministries, etc.). The aim is to find winning and shared solutions for new modalities of reception that enable the maintenance of the existing heritage and the recovery of spaces unused or under- utilised as socio-cultural destinations thanks to special and specific mapping.\r\n",
      "As a result, possible actions are:\r\n",
      "· Analysing and forecasting tourist flows in order to develop awareness strategies.\r\n",
      "· Carrying out a study on the capacity of the historical centre/city/territory, defining a set of indicators and a monitoring system to develop tourism management policies oriented towards sustainability.\r\n",
      "· Favouring projects related to touristic offers that are innovative or involve digitisation, in line with strategies of the smart development of the city as an intelligent service of the smart city itself (i.e. a city card app with additional services and a system of notifications that informs users about other spaces and attractions that are located in the same area, but are less crowded or less known). This also means promoting tourist opportunities outside of the traditional flow and seasonality (i.e. via a tourist card with multiple destinations and special offers for less popular sites).\r\n",
      "· Developing a sustainable mobility system that tourists can use to access suggested and promoted destinations (i.e. a tourist card that includes free use of public transport and dedicated shuttles to enhance the use of public and collective transport).\r\n",
      "· Creating European guidelines on how to better cooperate with and manage big private touristic services (such as Airbnb) in overcrowded cities.\r\n",
      "· Preserving the identity of cultural places and protecting them from any negative influences that tourism has on the residential and living conditions of citizens (a great number of regular apartments are used, in whole or in part, as types of hotels).\r\n",
      "· Checking available receptive structures for tourists and using the phenomenon of the sharing economy to strengthen the image of the city as a great tourist destination (while being careful to maintain a respectful balance between the city’s inhabitants and the travellers that desire to visit and enjoy the city).\r\n",
      "1. Better regulation:\r\n",
      "· Developing recommendations and regulatory interventions to create an effective regulatory framework in areas such as shared economy accommodations and new tourism service platforms, managing access to popular attractions and urban areas, managing traffic in busy parts of the city, countering irregular tourism businesses and professions and solving issues related to the public-private management of cultural heritage. This also means having forms of common management in compliance with possible EU regulations or guidelines, which combine the free circulation of people and tourists with the respect of the places and which regulate and give an answer to new spread phenomena (such as Airbnb). These common management rules may comprehend:\r\n",
      "· Monitoring the phenomenon of the abusiveness to guarantee that tourists\r\n",
      "receive a high quality reception/welcome and that management and control systems are in place in tourist locations.\r\n",
      "· Regulating temporary tourist rentals by establishing a limit for the number of nights they are available for rent (as in other major European cities) in order to ensure that residents remain in the central and historical areas of the city.\r\n",
      "· Making agreements with large platforms. In this regard, the agreement that the Municipality of Florence started with Airbnb – defined as a ‘collect- remit’ – includes remarkably positive aspects. The tourist tax is collected at the time of the booking and is transmitted automatically to the municipal administration by the platform. This means that the tourist tax is properly collected, and a significant amount can then be reinvested in projects to create a sustainable city.\r\n",
      "· Promoting the use of existing tools designed to help cities become sustainable tourist destinations (e.g. European Tourism Indicators System (ETIS), UNESCO Sustainable Tourism Toolkit).\r\n",
      "· Establishing effective participatory governance frameworks that enable shared, evidence-based, integrated decision-making processes among public authorities responsible for related policy areas, such as cultural\r\n",
      "heritage preservation, tourism management, spatial planning and infrastructures, also involving stakeholders (e.g. UNWTO, UNESCO, mobility managers) and civil society organisations. The involvement of all relevant actors shall contribute to the development of a common vision and strategic approach and to the agreement of medium- and long-term goals.\r\n",
      "· Developing infrastructures and services that facilitate the access to, and enjoyment of, points and places of interest, and the connection between sites through sustainable and multimodal mobility tools (e.g. shared mobility, smart ticketing, e-bikes, car parks, pedestrian zones, greenways), the creation of alternative routes and the strengthening of information points.\r\n",
      "· Involving local communities in permanent forums and local platforms in order to contribute to the development of tourism management strategies. Supporting authentic tourism experiences based on local cultural practices, local know-how, products and craftsmanship and promoting the engagement of residents and their exchanges with visitors (for example based on intangible cultural heritage).\r\n",
      "2. Better funding:\r\n",
      "· Providing funding and investments such as incentive measures, using tourism-derived incomes to improve local services and amenities and for creating new opportunities for the local community, supporting local trade and providing public grants or tax-credit measures targeted at start-ups in the field of tourism and specialist vocational training.\r\n",
      "· Enhancing the touristic appeal of lesser-known destinations. Leveraging on recognised labels and awards (e.g. UNESCO, Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe, European Heritage Label); creating new opportunities for the enhancement of lesser-visited heritage sites, for example by advertising thematic itineraries; promoting authentic intangible heritage and local crafts; and re-using abandoned buildings or industrial areas for cultural activities. Creating integrated cards allowing visits to both major attractions and lesser- known sites and developing customised tourism proposals (e.g. families, groups), dynamic packages and city experiences. Establishing a European award for the best sustainable destinations network.\r\n",
      "3. Better knowledge:\r\n",
      "· Data collection and analysis: implementing monitoring systems based on innovative methodologies for real-time collection and analysis of tourism flows (e.g. big data); developing forecasting models and monitoring results; profiling and segmenting tourism demand; conducting in-depth research on UNESCO historic city centres and their management plans.\r\n",
      "· Developing ICT solutions that support better knowledge and the circulation of information, developing technological applications for tourist information and orientation and adopting digital technologies to enhance the cultural experience of tourists (e.g. 3D, augmented reality, geographic information system (GIS)).\r\n",
      "· Carrying out peer learning activities and raising awareness for professionals, tourists and residents. Promoting interventions such as peer-learning\r\n",
      "activities for city representatives and local stakeholders; raising the awareness of visitors about local values, traditions and regulations; and drafting a European charter for tourists.\r\n",
      "· Developing guidelines for the planning and implementation of long-term interventions, along with a shared methodology to take advantage of previous experiences and to identify comparable procedures and methods.\r\n",
      "· Setting monitoring measures to better evaluate and control (before, during and after) planned and implemented actions (e.g. policy assessment, key indicators set).\r\n",
      "TOPIC 2 – CREATIVE AND CULTURAL SECTORS\r\n",
      "Creative and cultural sectors (i.e. digital services, creative use of spaces, innovative promotion of arts and culture, promotion of local know-how) are a means to create jobs and to sustain culture and innovation.\r\n",
      "Questions concern ways to attract talent, to create spaces for non-economically driven artists and to foster local know-how. Opportunities are heterogeneous and lessons learned are still to be consolidated.\r\n",
      "The reduction of social barriers for accessing culture is another challenging aspect that has been mentioned. In this context, ways to bring culture closer thanks to creative sectors and accessible cultural heritage could be worth exploring.\r\n",
      "Key issues\r\n",
      "Creative and cultural sectors offer interesting opportunities for the preservation of cultural heritage and the existing building stock in order to create jobs and support culture and innovation.\r\n",
      "The main challenges to be tackled include how to:\r\n",
      "· attract talent, create jobs and create start-ups;\r\n",
      "· create spaces for non-economically driven artists and cultural activities;\r\n",
      "· preserve and promote local know-how and (traditional) craftsmanship, but also to develop policies at the regional level (e.g. developing a strategy to attract creative sectors in small and medium-sized cities by creating conditions that enable them to acquire necessary funding, or sectorial actions such as exploring new digital services related to cultural enhancement and/or development).\r\n",
      "Cultural and creative sectors offer opportunities for the urban regeneration of many underutilised cultural heritage buildings (both publically and privately owned).\r\n",
      "Creative regeneration provides new spaces for creative activities, while using this creativity to regenerate and revitalise cultural heritage spaces by providing them with new content. The innovative power of the cultural and creative sectors should be used for the preservation, restoration and revitalisation of physical heritage assets.\r\n",
      "Cultural and creative sectors, together with cultural heritage sites, often help create unique environments that have the ability to re-assert the identities of the territories.\r\n",
      "Entrepreneurs operating within the creative and cultural sectors historically relied on subsidies, grants and their own resources to cover their financing needs. As those resources are no longer sufficient to cover financial needs, the sector is struggling to find alternatives. This hinders the creation and development of cultural and creative businesses.\r\n",
      "The financing ecosystem available for creative and cultural sectors is significantly underdeveloped, not only due to limited financial resources but also the knowledge barrier between financiers and entrepreneurs. More specifically, financial institutions are still very reluctant to finance creative and cultural sectors due to their perceived higher risk as compared to more mainstream economic business.\r\n",
      "In addition, entrepreneurs in the creative and cultural sectors are not used to approaching financiers, and this often results in the failure to receive financing from banks or investors. The effect of digitalisation is disrupting the business models of creative and cultural businesses, as they need to constantly devote additional resources to adapt to the new norm and to remain relevant.\r\n",
      "Challenges and key objectives\r\n",
      "The promotion of culture through fostering creative sectors remains a challenge. Managing new spaces for cultural activities (either for temporary or long-term use) is one of the biggest challenges faced by territorial planning. It is also a complex administrative responsibility that presents the most decisive factors for future development.\r\n",
      "This new life features the reuse of heritage buildings as hubs for creative and cultural renewal (social capital incubators and experimental playgrounds for new urban developments). It also introduces the need for high-level professionals in cultural heritage occupations as well as the need to develop new professional skills, including making better use of new technologies.\r\n",
      "The development and support of new managing models as well as the exchange of knowledge and programmes for boosting skills in cultural heritage professions would most comprehensively address these challenges. Successful creative urban regeneration processes present a participatory approach with redefined relationship patterns between new actors. A model is based on the cooperation between communities and authorities. Multidisciplinarity is the main feature of these creative communities, with a high density of knowledge based on creativity and participatory models. Creating the right conditions and providing support to implement these models would ensure the sustainability of these processes.\r\n",
      "It is necessary to manage assets through public-private cooperation, opening up to creative sectors and new forms of work, and encouraging the involvement of stakeholders at different levels. Public-private Partnerships can overcome the difficulties and ensure that urban regeneration projects are successfully implemented. Identifying the actions that should be taken to effectively address private owners is still a challenge.\r\n",
      "Innovation is the main element of these creative places (historical centres, old industrial buildings, etc.). Cultural and creative sectors can boost local\r\n",
      "development and business creation. In these locations, cultural and creative entrepreneurs create new cultural services with digital tools and open data. In this manner, they also contribute to strengthening and facilitating digital access to culture. The objective would be to develop specific programmes that link the cultural heritage sector with cultural and creative sectors to encourage the development of creative hubs, maker spaces, fab-labs, cultural centres, community centres, etc. by promoting a favourable ecosystem.\r\n",
      "The definition of cultural and creative “sectors” rather than of cultural and creative “industries” was discussed in order to broaden the approach5.\r\n",
      "Key aspects identified by the Partnership on this topic of creative and cultural sectors include the following:\r\n",
      "· Providing funding for creative and cultural small and medium-sized enterprises\r\n",
      "(SMEs)6 as well as digital heritage (heritage produced, presented and protected with digital technologies)7. Part of the solution in triggering private investment could be the Creative Europe Cultural and Creative Sector Guarantee Facility (CCS GF), which has earmarked EUR 121 million for the 2014-2020 period (topped-up with EUR 60 million through the European Fund for Strategic Investments)8 to guarantee loans to the sector provided by financial intermediaries, possibly leveraging over EUR 1 billion in loans.9.\r\n",
      "· Encouraging artists of any kind to move to deprived neighbourhoods to open\r\n",
      "their workshops, studios, galleries, theatres, etc. This could be encouraged by tax incentives or tax deductions for bringing cultural activities to the cities.\r\n",
      "· Utilising Funding the Cooperative City10, a book by experts who study community finance and the economy of civic spaces, and re:kreators11, which re-creates underperforming public areas and gives them a new meaning.\r\n",
      "· Providing legal, financial or administrative assistance services to cultural and creative sectors, or supporting their peer learning to foster creative investment in urban development projects and to ensure their sustainability.\r\n",
      "· Adopting an intra-generational approach, through which the strong entrepreneurial spirit of young people can be combined with the experience and skills of older people. This approach could entail the creation of creative hubs, which would also help to tackle social issues including depopulation and the lack of activities for elderly people.\r\n",
      "5 Cfr definition of cultural and creative sectors (market- and non-market-oriented) in Regulation (EU) 1295/2013 establishing the Creative Europe Programme (2014 to 2020), Art. 2 (1).\r\n",

      "· Developing a strategy to attract creative sectors to small and medium-sized cities by creating conditions that enable them to access necessary funding sources.\r\n",
      "· Ensuring the protection and promotion of cultural activities (even if not- profitable) through the correct development and implementation of urban policies. This would entail supporting creative artists (both economically and non-economically driven) through the establishment of dedicated spaces to be used for their activities.\r\n",
      "· Developing and implementing new innovative activities, which could be carried out by firstly mapping the current offer and demand and secondly starting a new collaborative process to design a targeted strategy.\r\n",

      "· Promoting and developing innovative models of participatory management of\r\n",

      "· Sustaining the creative sector through small associations/start-ups (i.e. using\r\n",
      "EU funding resources through existing programmes or guaranteeing the use of public spaces).\r\n",
      "· Exploring new digital services related to culture enhancement and/or\r\n",
      "development.\r\n",
      "· Using financial instruments instead of grants or subsidies or a combination of the two. The CCS GF is the first central, financial EU instrument dedicated to creative and cultural sectors, and its launch was an important milestone towards building a financing ecosystem for the industries and improving access to finance in Europe. More needs to be done, especially for earlier stage financing, starting with the support of new project ideas at the incubation phase to help\r\n",
      "12 The example of the EU Heritage project was given, which is financed by the Erasmus+ Sector Skills Alliances and has just been launched: https://www.encatc.org/en/projects/transnational-cultural-projects/; https://twitter.com/EUHerit_project\r\n",
      "13 For example, the French government has launched a programme ‘Action cœur de ville’ (for city centre regeneration projects) in order to develop cultural actions through ‘cultural creative neighbourhoods’, which are about the adaptive reuse of unused heritage buildings for cultural projects, including a virtual/numeric approach (museum, stage, library, art studio, etc.).\r\n",
      "them turn into successful businesses. Early stage financing for start-ups is also important, potentially through a central equity financial instrument or other means of financing that can tolerate higher risk-taking than traditional forms of financing. At the same time, financing resources need to be made available for the digital transformation needs of creative and cultural sectors.\r\n",
      "· Providing more technical assistance measures both to the financiers and to\r\n",
      "creative and cultural sectors so as to enhance their knowledge of one another.\r\n",
      "More specifically, financial institutions could be trained on how to adopt more targeted risk assessment methodologies that would factor in the intangible nature (e.g. intellectual property (IP) valuation, sources of value creation) and the specificities of the creative and cultural sectors (e.g. specific business models, revenue streams). Financiers/investors could also be supported in building up their network of industry-based stakeholders, which would contribute positively to identifying potential borrowers/investees.\r\n",
      "At the same time, the various stakeholders in the creative and cultural sectors, and especially entrepreneurs, should be provided with the means to better understand their financing options and the benefits and risks associated with each of them. This can be done through dedicated workshops where stakeholders are be trained on how to fill in loan applications, approach investors, etc. In addition, a centralised platform outlining all the different schemes that are available for creative and cultural sectors per country could be a very useful tool.\r\n",
      "· Showcasing the existing success stories through enhanced communication means in order to attract the interest of potential new talent, but also investors and financial institutions.\r\n",
      "· Making more efficient use of available financing resources, in order to achieve a more catalytic impact across creative and cultural sectors. For example, the use of financial instruments instead of grants or subsidies, or a combination of the two.\r\n",
      "· Bridging the knowledge gap between financiers and investors and creative and cultural industry entrepreneurs, in order to ease the dialogue between them and to make the financing process more fluid.\r\n",
      "· Keeping up with the digital disruption and helping with the digital transformation of the creative and cultural sectors.\r\n",
      "· Simplifying administrative requirements to access information and funding mechanisms on the theme of culture/cultural heritage.\r\n",
      "TOPIC 3 – TRANSFORMATION, ADAPTIVE REUSE AND URBAN RECONVERSION\r\n",
      "This cluster includes all the aspects of the transformation, revitalisation and reconversion of urban spaces (open areas and/or buildings), depending on the scale of the intervention.\r\n",
      "As a result of the economic and social transformation processes in Europe, many buildings and urban spaces have lost their original function. This has led to numerous abandoned sites and buildings, like former industrial areas, large health and social care facilities, churches and military sites as well as buildings from the second half of the 20th century (i.e. school buildings, department stores). These buildings and spaces are often found on urban fringes – often marginalised, peripheral areas – which are the interface areas of a city (i.e. areas that are not rural, but not urban). Many of these areas are abandoned, some have become spontaneous/illegal dumps, and all are unsecure places with no identity.\r\n",
      "But as in case of more contemporary post-war buildings, they are located at prominent sites in city centres as well. Today, these buildings and open areas constitute an important and challenging part of urban architectural heritage. They are not always listed buildings, but in the overall historic urban landscape, they form ensembles that are worthy of preservation and are part of the urban identity. Even though tourism may signify a source of economic growth in various sectors and provide new job opportunities in cities, large-scale touristification in those cities with an abundance of cultural, monumental and artistic offers may create a series of issues and may have a negative impact on the city itself. Large-scale touristification, as experienced by large or medium-sized historical cities, may encounter some of the following issues, which are currently highly debated both in academic and policy-oriented literature:\r\n",
      "· The urban space being transformed into a single-asset tourism city: The\r\n",
      "economy of the city becomes oriented to, and is dependent almost exclusively on, the flow of tourists. Moreover, they are often managed by an ‘oligopoly’ of the tourist market (i.e. conventional entrepreneurs, shared economy and disruptive innovators, large tour operators and national and global investors) and do not include any redistributive measures to inhabitants.\r\n",
      "· The city as a thematic park, ‘Disneyfication’ and a monoculture of services:\r\n",
      "Shops and cultural offers are transformed and oriented to please a tourism- related clientele. This can reduce the diversity of opportunities for residents, lead to higher than average costs for primary goods, lead to the closure of long- term established local shops and make it difficult for arts and crafts to survive.\r\n",
      "· The precariousness of the habitation: Short rental platforms such as Airbnb and\r\n",
      "HomeAway rely on tourism flows for their business. Although some European cities are experimenting with forms of regulating short rental platforms through profit taxation, limiting the number of available houses or limiting the number of days available for subletting, the business of these platforms remains largely unregulated. Furthermore, major real estate investors (both national and global) purchase large housing stocks for tourism-based short-term rentals, taking\r\n",
      "these housing options away from long-term residents – particularly in those urban areas that have a rich, architectural heritage. Those investments that rely on tourism also remain largely unregulated.\r\n",
      "· The consequences of tourism-related investments: Tourism-related\r\n",
      "investments are detrimental for long-term residents. They lead to rising rental costs, the unavailability of affordable housing close to the work place or to cultural attractions and, in many cases, forced or indirect evictions.\r\n",
      "· The pollution and saturation of public transportation, public spaces and\r\n",
      "infrastructures (including waste management): Many of these services and areas are not designed to welcome large tourist flows, especially in small and medium-sized historic cities where the existing historical urban pattern has a limited ‘carrying capacity’ for inhabitants.\r\n",
      "Key issues\r\n",
      "Adaptive reuse or urban reconversion projects often cause the disappearance of century-specific architectural heritage14. However, the adaptive reuse and reconversion of those buildings and urban areas for new functions (i.e. new residential, cultural or commercial uses) can also be a sustainable way to preserve those elements and their historical significance, as well as increase their social, economic and environmental value. Adaptive reuse and revitalisation can contribute to urban development, social cohesion and well-being. For example, the transformation of abandoned industrial buildings into residential ones can help solve housing shortages in growing cities. In declining cities, creative reuse can help stabilise or revitalise shrinking neighbourhoods.\r\n",
      "Bottom-up approaches to the management of territorial and urban assets can help local actors enhance their cultural heritage, strengthen local identity, and contribute to the preservation and/or redevelopment of their heritage. The participation of the local population is crucial and can have a beneficial impact on several social issues (i.e. the integration of migrants).\r\n",
      "In terms of environmental aspects, the reuse of heritage sites and buildings saves the embodied energy (the so-called grey energy) and the energy that would have been consumed by the demolition and the creation of a new building. Furthermore, the transformation of derelict sites has become an important policy objective, which could limit urban sprawl and greenfield development. In this context, the ‘zero value’ city – which does not allow new construction and only permits the reuse of sites already available – should be presented as an alternative to the expansion of cities.\r\n",
      "Moreover, revitalising and adaptively re-using those areas to create, for instance, green urban landscapes, urban parks or green infrastructures, means creating environmental and socio-economic opportunities.\r\n",
      "14 Cfr. Recommendation No. R (91) 13 from the Council of Europe – Committee of Ministers\r\n",
      "Overall, two aspects concerning the transformation, adaptive reuse and urban reconversion of urban heritage should be considered for sustainable development across its social, ecological and economic dimensions:\r\n",
      "· It is important to preserve the spaces and buildings with their rich history,\r\n",
      "architecture and territorial identities, as well as to promote the creation of new ones.\r\n",
      "· It is important to identify and consider the needs of the local population and to strengthen existing local identities.\r\n",
      "In order to enable a successful transformation process, the managing authority must keep a balance between the requirements of these two elements.\r\n",
      "Challenges and key objectives\r\n",
      "Despite the fact that there is a growing amount of literature on the negative impacts of tourism on cities, there are few tested solutions on how to control and steer tourism flows, reduce the impact of the large-scale arrival of tourists and avoid the negative impact of tourism on cities.\r\n",
      "Issues discussed by the Partnership bring forward the following aspects:\r\n",
      "· some cities have an abundance of cultural institutions and monuments, raising questions about the choice and type of the representation of heritage: which heritage and for whom?;\r\n",
      "· change and diversify both the number and the type of tourists, the occupation of public spaces and the distribution of profit among entrepreneurs and residents;\r\n",
      "· the political and economic model of society in the future;\r\n",
      "· ‘bridging the gap’ between urban planning processes and culture and cultural heritage approaches and initiatives is one challenge to overcome.\r\n",
      "The revitalisation of historic buildings, including the transformation of post- industrial spaces, the preservation of century-specific architectural heritage and the regeneration of abandoned buildings or post-mining areas, is a key element for numerous regions and cities (i.e. job creation, environmental redevelopment, avoidance of urban sprawl, socio-cultural growth, creation of identities). The Partnership recognised a substantial gap among European cities, as it was a real challenge for some but not relevant for others.\r\n",
      "However, regarding adaptive reuse and reconversion, overall challenges are linked to the integration of all aspects related to the adaptation/revitalisation of urban places: funding, management, gentrification and social aspects (i.e. ‘reconversion for whom?’) were the matters raised by the partners. As transformation changes the urban fabric of cities and local identities, part of this challenge is to balance the benefits of this transformation (e.g. ensuring that the process has a bottom-up component).\r\n",
      "The Partnership identified the following key issues on the topic of transformation, adaptive reuse and urban reconversion:\r\n",
      "· Reusing, adapting and transforming existing cultural heritage sites and\r\n",
      "buildings for cultural and social purposes;\r\n",
      "· Facilitating, delegating and managing investment in cultural heritage sites and buildings in a commercially feasible and an environmentally as well as socially responsible way15.\r\n",
      "Linked to these two key challenges and objectives are several more factors that need to be addressed:\r\n",
      "· Transformation, adaptive reuse and urban reconversion is difficult in shrinking\r\n",
      "cities as well as in growing cities. Growth and shrinkage often take place simultaneously in the same city. While high vacancy rates, vandalism and low market values pose challenges regarding the reuse and reconversion of urban heritage in shrinking cities or parts of the city, in growing cities a high pressure on the housing and real estate market – as well as high market values – endangers derelict urban heritage sites. Buildings that are not listed or registered as historical monuments, but are worthy of preservation, are particularly under threat.\r\n",
      "· The issue of ‘dissonant heritage’ as a heritage that ‘hurts’ or recalls past events\r\n",
      "that are not easy to reconcile with visitors’ values and everyday experiences (e.g. military sites, post-war places, etc.) needs to be tackled.\r\n",
      "· Reuse and reconversion processes are manifold, and many stakeholders have\r\n",
      "to be involved to match the skills, competencies and knowledge needed for high-quality heritage development (e.g. urban planners, architects, public authorities, built heritage professionals, local population, investors and owners). This means that a lot of delegation and management as well as integrated planning are necessary (see also section 2.3.6).\r\n",
      "· The relationships between heritage elements and new architectural\r\n",
      "interventions need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For adaptive reuse and reconversion of urban heritage, changes are to be permitted, but quality standards set for all new architecture in the existing building stock are to be evaluated.\r\n",
      "· Municipalities may not have the resources to rehabilitate buildings. If public\r\n",
      "authorities delegate the transformation to associations, they may lack the financial capacity, which may also raise questions of state aid and funding.\r\n",
      "· A considerable challenge lies in attracting investors for the transformation of cultural heritage sites and buildings as well as ensuring the longer-term sustainability of this investment. This raises related points regarding the ability of public authorities to provide quick responses to investors when it comes to changing property designations and authorisations as well as the need for alternative investment sources to avoid over-dependence on big investors16.\r\n",
      "15 Synergies could be sought with the Task Force on Circular Business and Financial Models or Cultural Heritage Adaptive Reuse in Cities (CLIC): https://www.clicproject.eu/task-force/\r\n",
      "16 The Horizon 2020 ROCK project was mentioned as an example of urban regeneration.\r\n",
      "· When opening former derelict areas or buildings to the public, social and urban planning issues must be addressed and considered. The reuse and transformation can lead to new social dynamics in the surrounding neighbourhoods (i.e. gentrification). Moreover, the reused and transformed site must be newly linked to existing urban structures and infrastructures (i.e. public transit links, new bike and pedestrian lanes connecting the formerly closed area to the neighbouring areas or other parts of the city).\r\n",
      "· The challenges and opportunities relating to derelict sites in cities were highlighted in the context of urban expansion into rural lands.

      "TOPIC 4 – FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND FUNDING\r\n",
      "This topic deals with the financial aspects related to investments in the field of culture and cultural heritage aimed at the conservation and enhancement of buildings, monuments or structures, the setting up of ‘cultural infrastructures’, and the rehabilitation of public spaces (including interventions made in the framework of complex processes of urban regeneration).\r\n",
      "Over the last decades, the preservation and enhancement of heritage have been pursued by using public financial resources, but not everywhere and not always with appreciable and lasting results. Problems related to the scarce availability of financial resources and the constraints frequently imposed on their use can influence design choices. These limits can lead to investments in non-optimal options or insufficient management solutions, and can compromise the financial sustainability of the investment over time.\r\n",
      "It is difficult for cities to initiate the process of rehabilitating and maintaining restored buildings or urban areas if they are meant to become social and cultural centres. Main challenges are: i) how to attract funding for the rehabilitation of spaces in case of initiatives with no or low generating revenues; ii) how to identify efficient management models; and iii) how the cultural sector (investments linked to culture and inclusion) may enable the upgrade of the urban economic status. This is to say, to boost the economic development of the city through the cultural sector (i.e. Torino with the transformation of the former industrial site of Lingotto, Bilbao with the Guggenheim, Barcelona with the rehabilitation of local markets by well-known and innovative architects, etc.)\r\n",
      "Examining ways to ensure adequate flows of financial resources and making their use more effective (both in the implementation and management phases) is an essential step towards achieving positive economic, social and environmental impacts in urban contexts and communities.\r\n",
      "Key issues\r\n",
      "When cultural heritage is managed by public intervention, oriented towards actions of protection and enhancement in order to guarantee its public use, as it is primarily institutional missions, public expenditures increase.\r\n",
      "In recent years, however, the need to reduce public spending has led to a reduction in financial flows for built heritage management (other priorities have been favoured). At the same time, the demand for goods and services related to cultural heritage has increased and become more specific and complex (largely due to the development of new technologies).\r\n",
      "Against this background – where the gap between available public resources and needs for investments has gradually increased – the role of private actors as financiers has proved to be an opportunity and/or a necessity.\r\n",
      "There have been many initiatives that have promoted the involvement of private actors, but many obstacles remain, and actions are rarely effective. The main obstacle concerns the low profitability of investments in cultural heritage and, more generally, investments aimed at social and cultural purposes. For this reason, the public share of investments appears to be essential. Therefore, effective and sustainable financing solutions are mainly related to forms of mixed financing that require a balanced and careful definition and the distribution of economic returns.\r\n",
      "Public bodies often find it difficult to access forms of mixed investment due to the economic value produced by the investment and also the risk of weakening the value of the cultural heritage, whose open accessibility, through private investment, could be negatively affected.\r\n",
      "Another set of issues concern the areas of competence and legislative apparatus: The issue of competences particularly concerns the public sector, which is primarily responsible for social objectives. These competences require:\r\n",
      "· defining the results expected from investment initiatives in terms of economic\r\n",
      "and social sustainability, and clearly showing the convenience for private investors (profit or non-profit);\r\n",
      "· introducing innovative solutions in management, in contracts, in products and\r\n",
      "services supply, and applying innovative approaches to the procedures of pre- commercial and innovative tenders;\r\n",
      "· utilising\tcommon\tEuropean\trules\tfor\tsponsorship,\tart\tbonuses\tand\r\n",
      "private/public collaboration.\r\n",
      "Beside the issue of finding financial resources for investment, the satisfaction of the financial needs concerning the management of cultural assets, services and infrastructures is even more critical. This theme clearly emerges when operating, for example, with the support of the European structural funds.\r\n",
      "Therefore, there is an emerging need to promote the improvement/evolution of the regulation framework, for instance as a support to start-up activities in the first years of post-investment.\r\n",
      "The problem of defining and adopting innovative management models appears to be one of the main challenges. For these reasons, a critical issue is the limited diffusion and poor adoption of evaluation processes in the selection of projects to be supported, in the selection of private partners and in the evaluation of the effects of the investment.\r\n",
      "· What qualitative and quantitative criteria are necessary to guarantee the long- term financial sustainability of an investment in the field of culture and cultural heritage in an urban environment?\r\n",
      "· What criteria and indicators can be used to measure the accountability and responsibility profiles of companies that collaborate in various capacities (direct investment, services, etc.) in the sector?\r\n",
      "Members of the Partnership were interested in addressing the challenge of better funding. Funding challenges include the difficulties that municipalities face when trying to attract funding to rehabilitate spaces and buildings for social and cultural purposes or to foster innovative rehabilitating processes. There are also challenges relating to how culture contributes to the economic position of a city (i.e. Torino, Bilbao and Barcelona are all cities that have managed to improve their economic situation through cultural planning). Urban investments linked to culture and inclusion should also be promoted more effectively (i.e. the financial sustainability of the management phase of minor cultural heritage sites is still a problem).\r\n",
      "Challenges and key objectives\r\n",
      "Partners recognised that financial sustainability could be a transversal and horizontal issue. Nevertheless, the main challenges identified were the following:\r\n",
      "· Attracting funding in cities for cultural activities, maintaining the cultural heritage\r\n",
      "and rehabilitating places for social and cultural purposes. The private sector can be an adequate source of funding; some instruments to attract the private sector are already in place, but the issue could be further tackled at the European level. To do so, there is the need to make culture and cultural heritage more ‘profitable’, where profitability refers to a new ‘cultural value’ shared by public, private and local community actors and takes into account both economic and social benefits.\r\n",
      "· Making the relationship between public administrations and private subjects (in\r\n",
      "particular, non-profit) more balanced in the case of investments with a social purpose that aim to utilise the contribution of private resources. Both public administrations and private subjects contribute towards common objectives, overcoming the logic of traditional tenders and moving towards tools that adopt co-design methods to share analyses, objectives and performance/service data in a framework of shared responsibility and the evaluation of results.\r\n",
      "· Promoting the adoption of evaluation practices in support of public\r\n",
      "administrations in the selection of interventions to be financed and private partners to be involved. These practices could assess the potential impact of interventions on culture based on the results achieved in terms of employment, quality of life, skills growth and the evaluation of the performance of private subjects.\r\n",
      "· Integrating management aspects within design phases more effectively, and\r\n",
      "pursuing integrated forms of management for goods and services according to the models of territorial networks. In particular, in all cases where the attractiveness of the assets and the economic returns are weaker, identify new models and/or improve the forms of cooperation between public and private in the management of goods and services.\r\n",
      "· Examining existing grant-based support for possible efficiency gains and\r\n",
      "exploring alternative methods of repayable public assistance or public-private co-financing in order to ensure sufficient financial support for culture and cultural heritage.\r\n",
      "· Identifying/characterising the added value of heritage rehabilitation (versus demolition followed by new construction) and communicating about it with all stakeholders, civil society and inhabitants in a participatory approach.\r\n",
      "Possible actions\r\n",
      "· Conducting systematic analyses of the existing funding programmes at the European level with regard to an adequate consideration of cultural concerns and the protection of cultural heritage. These analyses can be mainly based on the information frameworks available from the relevant European Commission Directorate-Generals concerning the actions supported by European policies and programmes. It could also be useful to develop a comprehensive survey on how different applications in various Member States may have influenced the results of investments. The survey should make a comparison among European experiences in relation to the different types of support and the possible different applications/interpretations of regulatory provisions.\r\n",
      "· Conducting comparative analyses of the forms of financing available for the\r\n",
      "cultural sector in Europe (public, private and public-private) for investments and management. The aim would be to identify effective models and simplified processes, with particular reference to legislative frameworks regarding public procurement, concessions, project financing, collaboration agreements, private financing (fundraising, crowdfunding, patronage, sponsorship, etc.) and taxation.\r\n",
      "· Conducting an evaluation of case studies to highlight if and to which extent the\r\n",
      "promotion of the quality of the landscape and of the urban fabric (protection and valorisation of the physical cultural heritage) lead to a sound sustainable and long-term development. In other terms, how the two factors of “conservation- development” (which have been always quoted as one against the other) are not a dichotomy as they can be both pursued at the same time.\r\n",
      "· Developing guidelines for the adoption of evaluation models in the context of\r\n",
      "financing processes in the cultural sector. Identifying a visible cultural heritage label for financing purposes (cultural heritage impact assessment). Evaluating the impact of investments in culture and measuring the accountability and responsibility profiles of private subjects.\r\n",
      "· Taking stock of and mapping existing possibilities/public instruments to\r\n",
      "incentivise private investment in culture and cultural heritage, with the aim of promoting better knowledge among cities and enabling the use of best practice by replicating successful models.\r\n",
      "· Developing, in cooperation with the European Commission and the European\r\n",
      "Investment Bank (EIB), a concept for a pilot blending facility that could address the specific needs of cities in terms of investment in culture and cultural heritage (e.g. by combining financial support from the EIB with EU grants to raise the attractiveness of specific financial instruments or loans).\r\n",
      "· Developing ‘culture bonds’. A culture bond is a bond that is specifically\r\n",
      "earmarked for use by culture and cultural heritage projects. The culture bond could come with tax incentives such as a tax exemption and tax credits, making\r\n",
      "it an attractive investment. This provides a monetary incentive to tackle prominent city culture and cultural heritage issues.\r\n",
      "TOPIC 5 – RESILIENCE OF CULTURAL AND NATURAL HERITAGE\r\n",
      "Cultural heritage is of great importance for the development of an identity within a community, within a city or beyond a city’s limits, and it contributes to human well- being. Historical locations, with their cultural and natural heritage, are powerful assets for attracting investments and promoting jobs in areas like tourism, crafts and construction.\r\n",
      "In addition, preserving the built and natural cultural heritage fosters environmentally sustainable development. The preservation and further development of existing buildings is an important factor for a more efficient use of resources. Urban natural heritage sites such as open spaces, gardens, parks and forests function as fresh air corridors, reduce heat stress and contribute to a positive urban microclimate.\r\n",
      "Therefore, cultural heritage – both built and natural – can make a significant contribution to the sustainable development of a city across its social, ecological and economic dimensions. As such, cultural heritage is widely recognised as a factor that increases the resilience of a city. Resilience is understood in this context as the ability of a system to prevent, recover from and adjust to external or internal changes and events like natural or manmade hazards.\r\n",
      "Furthermore, cultural heritage can be seen as a source or asset of resilience. This applies not only to historic town centres and to late 19th-century districts, but also to post-war settlements and former industrial and commercial areas (see also section 2.3.3). Activities underground should also be explored in terms of the preservation of natural and cultural heritage (e.g. water basins, geological morphologies, architectural ground monuments).\r\n",
      "Key issues\r\n",
      "As an adaptive and responsive system, the tangible and intangible heritage of a city or urban region adjusts to changing environmental conditions over the years and has likely endured several disasters and conflicts. Today, natural and manmade threads like air pollution, land loss, soil sealing, fire, floods or earthquakes affect the built and natural heritage and archaeological sites increasingly.\r\n",
      "Climate change in particular and its broad consequences are endangering urban cultural heritage as never before and pose a major challenge when it comes to preserving it. In Europe and all over the world, there has been a progressive loss of unique and irreplaceable cultural heritage sites, notably historical buildings and green heritage such as landscapes. Since built and natural heritage sites promote resilience, it is important to strengthen the assets at risk.\r\n",
      "The ageing cultural heritage structures therefore need to be safeguarded against the impact of climate change and natural disasters in order to be preserved for\r\n",
      "future generations. During earthquakes, the poor performance of older structures that form a large part of what is considered Europe’s architectural heritage highlights a key issue in ensuring their resilience.\r\n",
      "On the other hand, their low energy performance significantly increases their energy consumption and reduces thermal comfort, while at the same time adding the risk of humidity penetration and mould growth, which can be potentially damaging to cultural heritage.\r\n",
      "Challenges and key objectives\r\n",
      "Challenges related to this topic are mostly linked to climate change and manmade factors, which can threaten the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage. Rapid growth/shrinkage, as well as the demographic makeup of urban areas, also pose challenges.\r\n",
      "The four main challenges and key objectives for urban areas regarding resilience and heritage are to:\r\n",
      "· safeguard heritage sites from the impact of climate change and to lower their\r\n",
      "vulnerability;\r\n",
      "· improve the quality of cultural heritage and open/green spaces in order to reduce risks and promote heritage as an instrument for building resilience;\r\n",
      "· manage urban transformation processes without provoking/inducing further environmental risks (the maintenance of built cultural heritage and building stock is a key issue);\r\n",
      "· contribute to urban resilience by supporting new quality areas and projects that do not add pressure or constitute potential threats to the environment.\r\n",
      "Further challenges lie in dealing with archaeological sites, as well as abandoned and neglected built heritage. The archaeological heritage that emerges from the ground during construction work is a major issue in Mediterranean cities. The ‘scar’ created through excavations may be an asset or a burden to the urban environment. How we treat these areas and how we incorporate them into the urban context is an important challenge.\r\n",
      "Derelict, abandoned and collapsing buildings with heritage value pose another major challenge and threat in the urban environment. This is further worsened due to climate change, and cities require mechanisms to address this challenge.\r\n",
      "Members of the Partnership were interested in addressing the challenge of better funding. Finding ways to use existing funding and financial mechanisms more effectively could help tackle bottlenecks while bridging the gap in financing, especially in areas like integrated cultural projects. Advisory facilities also exist that could help bring resources to the sector.\r\n",
      "While structural and non-structural retrofit and repair interventions are clearly needed for cultural heritage structures, two main challenges can be foreseen:\r\n",
      "· achieving a performance enhancement without altering the heritage structure’s appearance;\r\n",
      "· the high costs and labour time required by the interventions.\r\n",
      "Possible actions\r\n",
      "Several possible actions to strengthen cultural heritage and urban resilience have been identified by the Partnership:\r\n",
      "· Strengthening disaster preparedness and establishing a risk and heritage\r\n",
      "management, since natural or manmade hazards become disasters when they affect people who are not prepared to cope with those events. Relevant supra- national, national, regional and local institutions in the field of disaster and heritage management must be networked and should work closely together.\r\n",
      "· Raising risk awareness and preparedness by establishing a risk communication\r\n",
      "between experts and local communities using different modes of communication (i.e. real-time exchange of information by new media, brochures, public briefings).\r\n",
      "· Protecting the cultural heritage from climate change and manmade factors by\r\n",
      "strengthening the participation and identification of the local communities. Managing authorities should therefore create identities for public spaces and allow people to take care of them personally (e.g. in the context of pilot projects).\r\n",
      "· Increasing the resilience of cities, notably by supporting cities dealing with\r\n",
      "integrated climate protection programmes (e.g. by exploring bio-architecture possibilities, which means designing and reconstructing buildings in an eco- friendly manner).\r\n",
      "· Developing urban agricultural sites, which focuses on rehabilitating periphery\r\n",
      "historical sites through food production in cities (i.e. productive green infrastructures, urban orchards). This will allow the partners to explore why urban agriculture should be part of sustainable urban planning in the future.\r\n",
      "· Identifying, evaluating and monitoring risks threatening the built and natural\r\n",
      "cultural heritage. Firstly, hazards and risk factors that have the potential to endanger heritage sites must be identified. Secondly, data on risks associated with those hazards must be gathered and analysed. Thirdly, strategies for mitigating risks at heritage sites have to be developed. For example, an analysis of the main tourist/culture areas to map their resilience; specific emergency/evacuation plans for the most crowded areas; and multilingual information on the action to be taken in case of natural disasters.\r\n",
      "At the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the idea of combined structural interventions for seismic protection and energy retrofitting to improve the thermal performance of heritage structures is being investigated as part of a project on improving the existing EU building stock (iRESIST+ project20). By carrying out an integrated retrofit, costs and labour time can be significantly reduced.\r\n",

      "TOPIC 6 – INTEGRATED AND INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES FOR GOVERNANCE\r\n",
      "Integrated and participatory approaches that allow actors from all levels of governance and relevant fields to be brought together are recognised as requirements for embedding culture and cultural heritage dimensions in the early stages of the urban planning and development programmes. These processes are neither recognised as a panacea of all challenges, nor as the way to forcedly promote sustainability and inclusive approaches. Nevertheless, participatory and bottom-up processes are believed to be needed to enable local stakeholders to bring out the identities of urban places.\r\n",
      "The community approach through the mobilisation of citizens is a key factor in the creation and enhancement of cultural heritage for people. Giving the management of urban places to associations to promote social and cultural activities is fundamental. In this context, the temporary use of spaces and the systematic support of this should also be taken into consideration.\r\n",
      "Integrated approaches can also facilitate the access to, and exchange of, knowledge and data. This aspect includes data collection mechanisms, experiences in developing and using indicators for guidance-based planning, the sharing of know-how and best practices, being informed about research, and support mechanisms and opportunities.\r\n",
      "Ensuring that the Partnership remains connected to relevant actors and initiatives is considered important.\r\n",
      "Key issues\r\n",
      "Culture and cultural heritage is a key factor in urban planning. It is important to ensure that cultural heritage is taken into account already in the early stages of urban planning processes. This means ‘bridging the gap’ between urban planning processes as well as culture and cultural heritage approaches and initiatives. Activity occurring underground is another element that urban planning should consider when looking for ways to preserve cultural heritage. Considering culture as a driver of urban development allows the city to be developed as a whole and promotes a sense of belonging.\r\n",
      "Challenges and key objectives\r\n",
      "The following challenges are recognized:\r\n",
      "· a holistic and participatory approach in urban planning (e.g. environment, social innovation, preservation of cultural heritage with an approach to accessibility for all)\r\n",
      "· a management and monitoring system for a city allowing its best use and promotion\r\n",
      "· anticipating changes and possible requests to answer to them while ensuring a high quality of the urban fabric and cultural heritage of the city.\r\n",
      "Possible actions\r\n",
      "· Analyse governance models for adaptive heritage use, according to the principles of participation, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability, collaboration, circularity, fairness and justice). Horizon 2020 projects CLIC, ROCK and Open Heritage are working on this.\r\n",
      "· According to the abovementioned governance model, develop a targeted tool for urban heritage management (e.g. Urban Culture and Heritage Management Plan) in which all the strategic actions, investments, regulations and management issues are presented in a coherent framework, including convergent and multi-sectorial actions.\r\n",
      "· Develop recommendations for cities to:\r\n",
      "· reverse the government-citizen relationship as a provider-customer model, establishing a more open, horizontal relationship with clear, mutually-agreed upon roles in cultural heritage decision-making processes;\r\n",
      "· create models and practices that increase the taking care of a dedicated heritage by its own community (e.g. by connecting local actors to vacant available spaces). A practice that has been proven to generate jobs and inputs for productivity;\r\n",
      "· minimise the effects of gentrification through mitigation strategies (toolkits, impact indicators, hospitality policies, Airbnb, etc.) that include clear and transparent prioritisation criteria and avoid a situation where financial factors prevail over the cultural value of the asset or over citizens' preference or needs;\r\n",
      "· facilitate consistency between regulations that apply to the same building/site including cultural heritage protection (e.g. UNESCO versus municipalities), building as well as environmental requirements;\r\n",
      "· help public buildings to become financially self-sufficient, identifying potential enterprises for adaptive re-use as well as investors and instruments to attract them;\r\n",
      "· promote culture and cultural heritage (and the governance process) as one of the elements that can bring together integrated urban/rural/territorial development processes (e.g. linking cultural aspects with integrated development via the Leipzig Charter II); and\r\n",
      "· improve existing regulatory and legislative frameworks at the local level favouring sustainability measures to be taken into account in cultural development and policies.\r\n",
      "· Have forms of common management in compliance with possible EU regulation\r\n",
      "or guidelines:\r\n",
      "· organise architectural and urban workshops with the population to share information about projects;\r\n",
      "· organise counselling for contracting authorities;\r\n",
      "· create dedicated places like interpretation centres for architecture (for example dedicated to heritage), or structures dedicated to sharing\r\n",
      "information and debate about intervention projects, in order to share knowledge with all concerned stakeholders, raise awareness and inform the general public.\r\n",
      "TOPIC 7 – CULTURAL SERVICES AND CULTURE FOR INCLUSIVE CITIES\r\n",
      "The challenge for cities is how the cultural participation of all social groups can be guaranteed in urban societies, which are becoming increasingly older and diverse and are experiencing greater income differences. The Partnership aims to identify the barriers to access culture for all.\r\n",
      "The focus is on the local cultural institutions that have existed in European cities for decades or even centuries: public libraries, regional museums, music schools, local galleries, music venues and performing arts institutions. The question of how to develop these local institutions in the light of the well-known major trends from digitisation to diversity and, at the same time, to keep them low-threshold and close to the local population, concerns cities throughout Europe.\r\n",
      "Reliable data, better funding and better regulation are urgently needed in this context. The relevance of the topic of cultural participation/inclusive cities has also been acknowledged in recent EU strategic cultural policy documents:\r\n",
      "· New European Agenda for Culture, May 2018 (under ‘Social dimension’ as a\r\n",
      "strategic objective);\r\n",
      "· European Framework for Action on Cultural Heritage, December 2018 (with actions under ‘Cultural heritage for an inclusive Europe: Participation and access for all’);\r\n",
      "· Work Plan for Culture 2019-2022, December 2018 (under ‘Priority B: Cohesion and well-being’).\r\n",
      "One of the goals is to fully include culture and cultural heritage in urban development policies at the EU, Member State or regional level. Innovative actions should also be implemented at the city level, and culture and cultural heritage should be mainstreamed in the main EU funding programmes.\r\n",
      "Key issues\r\n",
      "Cultural services in a city for all parts of society (the demographic challenge)\r\n",
      "For a constantly growing city, local cultural services need to adjust to the ongoing process as well. Therefore, it is important to set standards concerning staff, financing, technical equipment and space in order to develop lively neighbourhoods for everyone (particularly with populations growing larger, older and more diverse). Creating and recreating (after a period of ongoing budget cuts) local cultural services including libraries, music schools, youth art schools, local galleries, local museums and venues to perform music, dance and theatre will contribute directly to urban development, social cohesion and well-being.\r\n",
      "Cultural services should be accessible and usable by everyone regardless of whether they have been part of the city for generations or are newly arrived migrants, whether they are women or men, whether they are young or old, and whether they are digital natives or completely analogue people. To develop cultural\r\n",
      "institutions and the whole sector in a way that turns consumers into prosumers (producer + consumer), and to let the audience not just look and hear but also participate, is a very important goal in times when culture faces new competition from YouTube, Netflix and video games.\r\n",
      "This challenge raises a number of questions:\r\n",
      "· What will urban audiences and cultural players look like in the future?\r\n",
      "· How can cities adapt their cultural offer?\r\n",
      "· How can local heritage/cultural/creative actors work with ‘new commons’ to present the best content to the public?\r\n",
      "· How can already existing or new practices of co-creation and social innovation\r\n",
      "become a tool for institutional development?\r\n",
      "The digital challenge\r\n",
      "Digital natives will soon be the norm. The use of new technologies is becoming mainstream in the arts and in cultural programming. New technologies have had an impact on the way cities communicate with citizens and the way cities work with local stakeholders.\r\n",
      "· This challenge raises a number of questions: What will be the impact of new\r\n",
      "technologies on arts and culture in general?\r\n",
      "· What will be the impact of new technologies on audiences’ expectations in terms of local cultural actors and what they offer?\r\n",
      "· What will be the impact of new technologies on cultural institutions?\r\n",
      "· What will be the impact of new technologies on the way city administrations for culture work?\r\n",
      "The governance and networking challenge\r\n",
      "Cross-sectoral projects are multiplying at the local level (i.e. culture and health and well-being, culture and social inclusion, culture and entrepreneurship or economic development). Joining forces inside and outside the culture/heritage sector (through new and stronger Partnerships) is more and more advisable in the future. This challenge raises a number of questions:\r\n",
      "· How can local authorities encourage local actors to collaborate, share resources\r\n",
      "and explore more innovative ways to approach income generation?\r\n",
      "· How can local authorities broker better Partnerships for culture with other sectors, such as the private visitor economy sector?\r\n",
      "· With such cross-cutting projects multiplying, how can local authorities safeguard the intrinsic value of culture and make sure culture/heritage is not only seen as a tool for economic development or income generation?\r\n",
      "Challenges and key objectives\r\n",
      "· Providing access to culture for all, decentralising culture from city centres to neighbourhoods, and inspiring urban cultural and creative spaces (from\r\n",
      "classical institutions to hubs of citizens’ services, meeting places and third spaces).\r\n",
      "· Sharing successful/inspiring models of local and city administrations, which\r\n",
      "develop cultural services for all parts of society.\r\n",
      "· Improving knowledge of the evaluation of local cultural policies and their impact (in particular, policies relating to social inclusion, education, access to culture for all, health and well-being, and social sustainability).\r\n",
      "· Focusing on new types of support for the local cultural ecosystem or innovative governance structures/systems in which citizens/local actors are actively involved.\r\n",
      "· Addressing the challenge of digitisation and the digitalisation process for cultural institutions and administrations, especially when everyday life requires more and more digital skills and digital natives are becoming the norm.\r\n",
      "· Providing non-financial support to local cultural/creative and heritage actors besides the traditional model of financing new pieces of art.\r\n",
      "Possible actions\r\n",
      "· Peer learning activities (ideally a long-term, dedicated European funding programme) for city representatives and local stakeholders to learn from each other’s cultural strategies/guidelines (based on the model of the Culture for Cities and Regions initiative that Eurocities implemented21), including thematic study visits, coaching by city peers and experts, and peer-learning visits.\r\n",
      "· The promotion of an integrated urban cultural management plan at the local level.\r\n",
      "21 http:// www.cultureforcitiesandregions.eu\r\n",
      "2.4 General objective of the Partnership\r\n",
      "The aim of the Partnership on Culture and Cultural Heritage is to enable municipalities, Member States, EU institutions and interest groups, NGOs and partners from the industry to work together on an equal footing to find solutions that improve the management of the historic built environment of European cities, promote culture, and preserve the quality of urban landscapes and heritage.\r\n",
      "These general objectives are not an objective in itself, but are a powerful tool aimed at achieving social, ecological and economic goals.\r\n",
      "In line with the work of the Commission on better regulation, the Partnership will lay out an Action Plan aimed at a more effective and coherent implementation of the existing EU strategies in and for cities. Additional focuses include making it easier to access EU funding, promoting combined financing from EU funds (better funding), improving the knowledge base on urban issues and Baukultur, and improving the exchange of best practices (better knowledge).\r\n",
      "General objectives include the following:\r\n",
      "· Raising awareness of, and increasing knowledge about, the ideal and material value of built environment heritage among experts, the general public and politicians.\r\n",
      "· Broadening the concept of the European city. On the one hand, the European city stands for mixed functions. On the other, it is primarily defined spatially by its Etruscan/Hellenic/Roman and/or medieval origins. It is imperative to broaden the concept to include more historical periods. The overlaps and recognisable parallels of all the architectural movements of the last few centuries and decades must be taken into account. Multi-functionality must be viewed in the context of all historical eras of the city.\r\n",
      "· Promoting the exchange of experience, good examples and solutions in urban development based on existing stock (network).\r\n",
      "· Improving the cooperation between the scientific community, politics and the administration.\r\n",
      "· Enhancing local autonomy with regard to procedures and processes related to planning and urban development (e.g. analysis of expert qualifications, on interdisciplinary project Partnerships).\r\n",
      "· Developing, strengthening and testing new and alternative governance models for municipalities.\r\n",
      "· Identifying specific problem fields or tensions and working out potential solutions\r\n",
      "(e.g. heritage conservation versus use versus tourism).\r\n",
      "· Establishing integrated urban development focused on existing stock as an approach in action and funding.\r\n",
      "· Stressing the importance of the development of existing stock more strongly as a starting point for sustainable urban and spatial development in national and European strategies.\r\n",
      "· Strengthening citizen and civil society involvement, and public participation, in urban development.\r\n",
      "· Attuning EU funding programmes more strongly to built environment heritage and the concerns of developing and protecting existing building stock.\r\n",
      "· Studying successful/exemplary funding programmes in Member States to\r\n",
      "determine whether they are transferable or appropriate to an EU-wide application.\r\n",
      "2.5 Specific objective of the Partnership\r\n",
      "2.5.1 Better regulation: Possible objectives under this domain\r\n",
      "· Regulating holistic and participatory approaches in urban planning (environment, social innovation, preservation of cultural heritage with an ‘accessibility for all’ approach).\r\n",
      "· Developing management and monitoring tools for a city in order to maximise its use and promotion. Also, anticipating possible requests and therefore being able to respond to them while ensuring the city is beautiful and can be enjoyed.\r\n",
      "· Developing a targeted tool for urban heritage management (e.g. the Urban Culture and Heritage Management Plan), in which all the strategic actions, investments, regulations and management issues are presented in a coherent framework, including convergent and multi-sectorial actions.\r\n",
      "2.5.2 Better funding: Possible objectives under this domain\r\n",
      "There are funding possibilities for cultural and urban issues within existing EU programmes (the ESIF, Horizon 2020, etc.). However, funding opportunities are not often related to cultural heritage in urban areas.\r\n",
      "The challenge here is twofold: one at the EU level and one at the local level. On the one hand asking the EU level to create financial opportunities especially dedicated to foster the cultural heritage in urban areas and to increase complementarities and integration among different programmes/projects (for example giving a reward during the selection criteria or aligning the different procedures and eligibility of expenditures). On the other hand enabling local authorities to improve instruments devoted to cultural heritage and better investments aware of urban local identities. The funding opportunities should be identified by strategically using the ESIF (e.g. EU funds under Policy Objective 5 of the programming period 2021-2027), together with national public funds and public/private investments.\r\n",
      "2.5.3 Better knowledge (base and knowledge exchange): Possible objectives under this domain\r\n",
      "Reliable data are important for showing the diversity of the structures and tasks of urban authorities, and for evidence-based policy-making. Reliable data are also necessary for monitoring and evaluating implemented solutions. These processes help provide tailor-made solutions to major challenges.\r\n",
      "There are already many examples of solutions for handling cultural heritage and existing building stock in urban areas, but it is still challenging to share this information and transfer it to other urban areas in Europe with specific backgrounds.\r\n",
      "The main objective is to support local policy-makers to build future-fit administrations for culture and cultural heritage. This could be done through a peer-learning programme where cities could learn from each other on smart policies.\r\n",
      "Although all cities are different, they share the same issues. Solutions successfully implemented in one city can easily be transferred to the next, taking the local context into account. This can be done through peer-learning programmes supported by the EU.\r\n",
      "The Culture for Cities and Regions initiative is a great example of the added value of EU funding. Such peer-learning processes are very difficult to implement – at least at such a scale – and it allows for the involvement of a high number of professionals working in the field of culture and creative sectors at a local level.\r\n",
      "Sustaining and strengthening this component of the initiative over the long run would certainly contribute to delivering greater social, economic and cultural impacts across Europe in a cost-effective way. Some very interesting examples have already taken place within Culture for Cities and Regions, with some participants transferring an initiative from study visits in their home city. As the peer-learning activities have proven to be very successful, more peer-to-peer activities (such as study and coaching visits) should be organised and/or encouraged in future initiatives.\r\n",
      "Peer-learning activities facilitate the exchange of experience between cities and regions and strengthen cooperation on cultural policies. This exchange also leads to long-lasting relationships between cities and regions. These exchanges may comprehend:\r\n",
      "· a mobility programme for cities’ politicians and directors/key municipal players\r\n",
      "on culture and cultural heritage, who could spend short periods of time in other cities to learn how policies are developed and implemented in other local contexts;\r\n",
      "· tools for local experts;\r\n",
      "· trainings for local city experts (e.g. capacity building workshops);\r\n",
      "· shared practical tools (e.g. toolkits and guidelines with practical advice), and networking events for cities’ politicians.\r\n",
      "The demand from local practitioners is already there and should be strengthened, as proven by the number of applications that cities and regions sent to participate in Culture for Cities and Regions peer-learning activities.\r\n",
      "The tools developed during Culture for Cities and Regions (templates, coaching methodology, etc.) should be used, promoted and updated continually. For instance, the Culture for Cities and Regions website could be updated and transformed into a general tool to update cities and regions about local and European cultural policy-making.\r\n",
      "2.5.4 Cross-cutting issues\r\n",
      "· Good urban governance;\r\n",
      "· Urban-rural, urban-urban and cross-border cooperation;\r\n",
      "· Sound and strategic urban planning;\r\n",
      "· Integrated approaches;\r\n",
      "· Innovative approaches;\r\n",
      "· Impact on societal change, including behavioural change;\r\n",
      "· Challenges and opportunities of small and medium-sized cities;\r\n",
      "· Urban regeneration;\r\n",
      "· Adaptation to demographic changes;\r\n",
      "· Availability and quality of public services of general interest;\r\n",
      "· International dimension (Habitat III and the SDGs).\r\n",
      "2.6 Conditions for meeting the above objectives\r\n",
      "Actions/topics taken into consideration in the Partnership will have:\r\n",
      "· urban relevance, being a subject of urban competence or having an impact at the urban level;\r\n",
      "· an EU demonstrated need – i.e. a problem faced by a substantial number of Member States and cities – and visible impact on legislative, financial and factual issues;\r\n",
      "· European character – i.e. an action and a bottleneck that is recognised as relevant by all the members of the Partnership and that has:\r\n",
      "· a general scope (the implementation of the proposed action does not depend on a single national administration);\r\n",
      "· an added value (the action is actually more effective and efficient if carried out with a multilevel governance process at the European level);\r\n",
      "· a real feasibility (the action must be operational and enforceable – the Partnership should first finalise what is necessary for this purpose: legislative checks, technical studies, etc.);\r\n",
      "· a novelty character (the action must not contain ‘recycled’ elements – i.e. proposals already developed elsewhere or activities that would be implemented regardless).\r\n",
      "3. FUNCTIONING\r\n",
      "3.1 Working arrangements\r\n",
      "Following the provisions in the Pact of Amsterdam and in the Working Programme of the Urban Agenda for the EU, the main focus of the Partnership will be to prepare, adopt and implement an Action Plan that aims for better regulation, better funding and better knowledge relating to the overall theme of culture and cultural heritage, and the identified sub-themes:\r\n",
      "· defining the administrative issues of the Partnership, including tasks and\r\n",
      "responsibilities agreed and committed to by the Coordinators and partners, based on the themes identified for local development;\r\n",
      "· mapping the existing EU frameworks and initiatives;\r\n",
      "· identifying the main EU/national/local level bottlenecks and burdens that pose problems when it comes to promoting the local economy and business development, employment and training;\r\n",
      "· preparing an Action Plan consisting of concrete proposals for improvements in EU legislation, funding and knowledge, in order to provide more favourable conditions for local entities and increase urban knowledge;\r\n",
      "· monitoring and involvement in the implementation of the Action Plan’s proposals; and\r\n",
      "· ensuring the transparency of the process through the consultation with other Partnerships and stakeholders.\r\n",
      "The Partnership is not a traditional network for knowledge and experience exchange. Instead, each partner will have concrete responsibilities and will commit to complete specific parts of the Action Plan.\r\n",
      "A thematic working group will be set up for the five topics identified, according to the interest of each Partnership member, while the topics n. 4 “Financial Sustainability and Funding” and n. 6 “Integrated and Interdisciplinary Approaches for Governance” will be considered transversal to all the other topics. Each working group will be asked to work and define possible actions investigating the integration and relationship (an action can be cross-cutting, this is to say, it can cover more than one topic). The problems of funding of topic n.4 (i.e. how to attract financial resources, how to manage them, how to integrate different sources, etc.) and the problem of governance of topic n.6 (i.e. how to involve different actors, how to integrate different approaches and/or thematic issues, etc.) should be taken into consideration by each working group (they are transversal and cross-cutting topics that affect all the other members).\r\n",
      "Draft actions proposed by each working group will be prioritised and selected by the whole Partnership following a general template to reach an agreement on which actions are most relevant and urgent. This will ensure that the issues of better regulation, better funding and better knowledge are being tackled\r\n",
      "consistently throughout the Partnership, and will help identify cross-sectoral issues that need to be further developed.\r\n",
      "Each thematic working group will further specify the sub-theme and research questions, identify the need for specific work and support (by either the Commission, the Partnership Secretariat or other means), and identify possible activities to be undertaken.\r\n",
      "The working groups will report back to the Partnership during plenary meetings. The work of each sub-working group will be finalised through a report, which will be included in the Partnership’s Action Plan.\r\n",
      "3.2 Working methods\r\n",
      "Working methods include physical meetings, online and phone conferences, surveys/questionnaires, brochures (to increase the reach of the exchanges beyond the members of the Partnership) and other working procedures, e.g. online file sharing and working platforms.\r\n",
      "Physical meetings are arranged as plenary meetings with interactive thematic working groups and/or as thematic working groups meetings.\r\n",
      "3.2.1 Role of the Coordinators\r\n",
      "The main task given to the Coordinators is to prepare the Partnership’s Action Plan. This includes the following steps.\r\n",
      "Organising the work of the Partnership, including:\r\n",
      "· organising and chairing the Partnership meetings;\r\n",
      "· organising and coordinating the work packages;\r\n",
      "· ensuring coherence and coordination between sub-working groups;\r\n",
      "· providing the necessary formats for templates, meetings and support (requests);\r\n",
      "· identifying cross-sectoral issues and knowledge gaps within the Partnership’s activities;\r\n",
      "· providing quality control services and ensuring the involvement of those with relevant expertise;\r\n",
      "· drafting and finalising the Action Plan on the basis of the reports from the\r\n",
      "working groups; and\r\n",
      "· working closely with the Partnership secretariat.\r\n",
      "Representing the Partnership, including:\r\n",
      "· establishing links with the Commission services;\r\n",
      "· reporting the activities and the progress to the Commission, especially those services related to the thematic issue of the Partnership, plus the UDG (Urban\r\n",
      "Development Group) and the Presidency of the EU, the European Parliament and the European Committee of the Regions;\r\n",
      "· maintaining the connection with the other Partnerships;\r\n",
      "· promoting the results and engaging with other interested urban areas and Member States; and\r\n",
      "· organising a public consultation on the draft Action Plan.\r\n",
      "3.2.2 Role of the partners\r\n",
      "The partners play a crucial role in bringing forward the working packages to which they have committed themselves. The Coordinators will also assume the role of partner in the Partnership and will therefore be fully engaged in the development of the content.\r\n",
      "All partners are asked to:\r\n",
      "· assume concrete roles and activities;\r\n",
      "· contribute to and/or lead one or more thematic working groups;\r\n",
      "· participate in Partnership meetings, engage with experts and expertise from external networks, and promote the activities of the Partnership to these networks;\r\n",
      "· share knowledge and experience, and generate ideas for the Action Plan;\r\n",
      "· contribute to the implementation of different actions of the Action Plan; and\r\n",
      "· make available the necessary resources required to guarantee these commitments to the Partnership.\r\n",
      "3.2.3 Role of the other partners and observers\r\n",
      "The other partners and observers (JPI, URBACT, Eurocities, ICLEI, etc.) will be working with the partners, broadening the knowledge base, and supporting the dissemination of the results of the Partnership to a larger group of urban authorities and relevant stakeholders.\r\n",
      "The partners and observers will also fulfil an important role in ensuring there is capacity for policy development and delivery, providing access to knowledge, and sharing know-how on all aspects of sustainable urban development in order to improve existing urban development policies. These partners can also provide support during the consultation process.\r\n",
      "3.3 Internal communication\r\n",
      "All information about the Partnership and relevant documentation is stored in a SharePoint folder that is managed by the Technical Secretariat. The SharePoint folder is accessible by all members of the Partnership, and all partners can read and edit documents on SharePoint.\r\n",
      "The Technical Secretariat provides updates and communicates on behalf of the Coordinators to the Partnership as a whole or to selected partners (depending on the subject), through a dedicated email box: UA.Culture.Heritage@ecorys.com.\r\n",
      "The Technical Secretariat also keeps an updated contact list of all the members, which can be accessed by all partners. When requested, the Technical Secretariat sets up conference calls on various platforms that Coordinators can use to plan the Partnership’s work .\r\n",
      "3.4 Role of the Secretariat\r\n",
      "Besides a range of activities that the Technical Secretariat of the Urban Agenda for the EU provides to the Commission (e.g. reporting, supporting the organisation of coordinator meetings, monitoring the Partnership’s activities), the support that it provides to the Partnership is divided into four specific tasks.\r\n",
      "1. Methodological, organisational and technical support\r\n",
      "The main activities delivered by the Technical Secretariat under this task are:\r\n",
      "· assisting and advising Coordinators with setting up the Partnership and how it functions;\r\n",
      "· providing methodological advice and support to the Coordinators and the\r\n",
      "Partnership;\r\n",
      "· developing and continuously updating the Partnership’s members mailing list;\r\n",
      "· assisting the Coordinators with the organisation of Partnership and technical progress meetings;\r\n",
      "· participating in, facilitating and assisting with Partnership meetings and drafting the minutes;\r\n",
      "· assisting Coordinators with the monitoring, stock-taking and follow-up of Partnership activities; and\r\n",
      "· managing and providing training on the use of the SharePoint platform for the\r\n",
      "Partnership’s work.\r\n",
      "2. Thematic expertise, research support and management of experts’ contracts\r\n",
      "External or in-house experts with EU experience on specific topics related to the Partnership can be mobilised by the Technical Secretariat. Upon the Partnership’s or Coordinators’ approval, expertise days are made available for specific content- related activities, including providing analytical work, reviewing and drafting documents, analysing surveys, structuring deliverables, etc. The Technical Secretariat regularly informs the Partnership about the available (remaining) expertise days and manages the contracts of the experts.\r\n",
      "3. Dissemination, outreach and communication support\r\n",
      "The Technical Secretariat supports the dissemination, outreach and communication on the Urban Agenda in general as well as on the Partnership specifically, aimed at stakeholders and the general public. Communication activities are mainly carried out via the online platform Futurium22.\r\n",
      "The main tasks of the Technical Secretariat in this area include:\r\n",
      "22 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/culture-and-cultural-heritag\r\n",
      "· designing the Partnership’s visual style and promotional material (e.g. logos and templates);\r\n",
      "· developing informational material to be used internally and designing\r\n",
      "communication products for external use;\r\n",
      "· maintaining the collaborative Futurium platform, including drafting and publishing articles related to the Partnership.\r\n",
      "4. Management and reimbursement of approved travel expenses\r\n",
      "Based on the need and request of the Partnership, the Technical Secretariat organises and reimburses travel expenses for members. Travel and accommodation expenses are covered in exceptional cases only. The reimbursement of costs is only applicable to partners (not Coordinators), and these must be approved by the Coordinators and the Commission.\r\n",
      "4. WORK PLAN\r\n",
      "4.1 Project plan\r\n",
      "The Urban Agenda Partnership on Culture and Cultural Heritage will last for three years, and the project plan is explained here per year.\r\n",
      "4.1.1 Year one\r\n",
      "Through physical plenary meetings and remote exchanges (i.e. conference calls, emails, questionnaires/surveys) – so to reduce, at the minimum, the travelling cost and avoid multiple thematic meetings that are not easy for members to attend – the first year is devoted to:\r\n",
      "· getting to know each other to exchange information and visions, but also to\r\n",
      "understand the background capacity of the partners;\r\n",
      "· identifying challenges in relevant fields common to all members of the Partnership;\r\n",
      "· testing the identified topics with other external relevant actors (i.e. UNESCO, ICOMOS) and interested stakeholders – this step is arranged through an open ‘working conference’ organised as a ‘Participatory Lab’ during the European Week of Regions and Cities (EWRC).\r\n",
      "The main output of the first year is the Orientation Paper.\r\n",
      "4.1.2 Year two\r\n",
      "The second year will be spent defining actions relevant to the main overall purpose: improving the implementing capacity for cities to achieve results in the culture and cultural heritage fields.\r\n",
      "Starting at the end of the first year (at the last plenary meeting, with interactive exercises) and before the first six months of the second year (2020), all possible draft actions are expected to be defined.\r\n",
      "This exercise will be arranged in two steps:\r\n",
      "1. listing and identifying all possible draft actions by thematic working groups, arranged by identified topics.\r\n",
      "2. exploring all possible transversal connections to define cross-cutting thematic issues. Once the clusterisation has been agreed upon, the Partnership will select the most relevant and urgent actions.\r\n",
      "The main output of the second year is the Action Plan, which will be adopted under the future German Presidency of the European Council.\r\n",
      " (\r\n",
      "Definition of ‘action’ under the Urban Agenda of the EU:\r\n",

      ")\r\n",
      "4.1.3 Year three\r\n",
      "The third year will be dedicated to the implementation phase.\r\n",
      "Once the feedback on the actions identified has been closed and prioritisation has been arranged, the Partnership will select those actions that will be implemented as pilots in the third year. As a result, an implementation plan for those pilot actions will be drafted.\r\n",
      "The implementation plan will be drafted by those members directly interested in each action. It will define the road map of each action with assumptions, deliverables and results.\r\n",
      "Coordinators will facilitate the implementation phase and will be responsible for the overall results.\r\n",
      "4.2 Deliverables, milestones and timing\r\n",
      "Based on the experience of the other Urban Agenda Partnerships, five key phases towards the finalisation of the Action Plan can be identified:\r\n",
      "1. Setting up: A kick-off meeting was organised in Berlin on 22 February 2019. Attendees brainstormed themes and challenges/problems and the production of the orientation plan.\r\n",
      "2. Orientation: The Partnership worked on a first draft of the Orientation Paper. As a first step, the Coordinators produced a survey that was submitted to all partners (see Annex II). The results of the survey were analysed and confirmed the need to work on seven topics. The second step was the involvement of technical partners and relevant actors in the field of cultural heritage at the event meeting during EWRC in Brussels.\r\n",
      "3. Drafting the Action Plan: This phase will focus on drafting the Action Plan and on the validation procedure among partners. To discuss the methodology and to define the actions that will be implemented, a meeting will be organised in April 2020.

      ")\r\n",
      "While the Monitor includes 168 cities in 30 European countries, for the present chapter a sub-set of 42 cities representative of European diverse urban landscape has been selected so to identify three main typologies of cities and challenges to be addressed, namely:\r\n",
      "· 10 so called ‘major attractors’;\r\n",
      "· 16 cities with attractiveness issues, related to tourism but also, more generally, to inhabitants, companies, talent and investments;\r\n",
      "· 16 cities with attractiveness potential, related to tourism but also, more generally, to inhabitants, companies, talent and investments.\r\n",
      "The cities in the sample have been selected based on their performance on the C3 Index within each population group - namely the extra, extra-large (XXL) group of 20 cities with more than1 million inhabitants, the extra-large (XL) group of 40 cities with between 500 000 - 1 million inhabitants, the group of 40 large (L) cities with between 250 000 and 500 000 inhabitants and the group of 79 small to medium- sized (S-M) cities with less than 250 000 inhabitants) – in three steps:\r\n",
      "· Identification of the 10 cities at the top of the C3 Index ranking out of the 21 cities in the largest population group (XXL) with more than 1 million inhabitants23;\r\n",
      "· Identification of the 5 cities occupying from the 6th up to the 10th position of the C3 Index ranking in each of the three remaining population groups (XL, L and S-M), meaning 15 in total, to detect cities with attractiveness potential;\r\n",
      "· Identification of the 5 cities occupying the lowest positions of the C3 Index ranking in each of the three remaining population groups (XL, L and S-M), meaning 15 in total, to detect cities with attractiveness issues.\r\n",
      "42 cities have thus been retained, namely the 40 cities so identified plus Coimbra and Florence (both in the Urban Partnership) which were assigned to the second and third group respectively, due to their very similar performance to the other cities included in these two groups, based on the above mentioned criteria. Their performance was then analysed with a view to detect major challenges at stake in relation to the three overarching domains covering by the Monitor, namely Cultural Vibrancy, Cultural Economy and Enabling Environment.\r\n",
      "The challenges and possible actions are then illustrated in more details using six- related topics which have been selected by the Partnership as priority areas of work, namely: a) Tourism, b) Transformation, adaptive reuse and urban reconversion, c) Cultural and Creative Industries, d) Resilience of cultural and natural heritage, e) Financial sustainability and f) Integrated & interdisciplinary approaches for governance.\r\n",
      "While the Monitor offers an initial overview, the identification of the specific topics to be addressed is a key step towards to development of ad hoc urban policies. Despite being broad, the set of 29 quantitative indicators that feed the Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor is indeed intended to capture some of the multifarious aspects of culture and creativity in cities for which city-level comparable data are available (for a more comprehensive discussion on ‘actual’ and ‘ideal’ metrics of culture, see Montalto, Tacao Moura, Langedijk & Saisana, 2019).\r\n",
      "23 The selection of the ‘major attractors’ has been limited to the largest population group as this is the one including largely recognized attractors in Europe.\r\n",
      "Culture-related challenges that European cities face\r\n",
      "The tables below show where each city is performing well and less well across the nine policy dimensions covered by the Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor, compared to the other cities in the same population group.\r\n",
      "As regards the so-called ‘major attractors’, cities generally perform well on most of the dimensions. Paris (France), for instance, is extremely strong all dimensions compared to its peers, although margins of improvement can be identified on Openness, Tolerance & Trust (D3.2). Munich (Germany), instead, performs well mostly on Intellectual Property & Innovation (D2.2), Openness, Tolerance & Trust (D3.2) and Quality of Governance (D3.4) compared to similar cities based on population size. A different picture can be depicted for Prague (Czech Republic) as well: the Czech capital is very strong on Cultural Venues & Facilities (D1.1) and achieves good results on both New Jobs in Creative Sectors (D2.3) and Cultural Participation & Attractiveness (D1.2). However, the city needs to improve its Enabling Environment across all the four underlying dimensions, compared to its ‘population peers’.\r\n",
      "Overall, no city leads on all measured aspects. A strong specialisation in one area can coexist with a weak performance in another, where future investments could eventually be directed.\r\n",
      "Interestingly, however, as signalled by the dimension where the red colour mostly appears there is one area that calls for attention, namely New Jobs in Creative Sectors (D2.3). This dimension measures the number of jobs created in a year by newly created cultural and creative companies. This area seems to be problematic for two Southern cities (Milan-Italy and Barcelona-Spain). However, more a city- specific issue, this result may be explained in the context of the overall lower growth rates registered by Southern Europe compared to the rest of Europe. Improving job creation dynamics in the field of culture and creativity may thus require a common macro-regional approach, involving all government levels (local, regional, national).\r\n",
      "Table 1. Performance of European ‘major attractors’ across the Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor’s nine policy dimensions\r\n",
      "As regards cities with attractiveness potential, all the cities in the sample except Bratislava (Slovakia) and Leuven (Belgium) perform relatively well on Cultural Participation & Attractiveness (D1.2). More importantly, all cities can count on a number of assets which they can mobilise to further improve their attractiveness.\r\n",
      "New Jobs in Creative Sectors (D2.3) however represents a potentially problematic area in this group, especially for cities such as Ghent (Belgium), Helsinki (Finland), Bologna and Florence (Italy) and Norwich (United Kingdom). How can cities make the most of their cultural heritage as well as current creative workforce as leverage to attract investments and talents and create new jobs in the cultural and creative sectors?\r\n",
      "Table 2. Performance of European cities with attractiveness potential across the Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor’s nine policy dimensions\r\n",
      "As regards cities with attractiveness issues, a very different picture emerges. Compared to their peers, cities at the bottom of the C3 Index ranking indeed face challenges on a number of areas, although good performance on some specific areas can still be identified. Both the cities of Turin (Italy) and Genoa (Italy), for instance, perform well on both Cultural Venues & Facilities (D1.1) and Local & International Connections (D3.3). Saint-Etienne (France) and, to a lesser extent, Bordeaux (France) achieve a good score on Quality of Governance (D3.4). Iaşi (Romania), on the other hand, records a good performance on both New Jobs in Creative Sectors (D2.3) and Openness, Tolerance & Trust (D3.2).\r\n",
      "One way to identify common challenges is to look at the dimensions where the red coloured boxes mostly appear. Following this approach, defies seem to concentrate in the following areas: Cultural Participation & Attractiveness (D1.2), as it could be expected, as well as Creative & Knowledge-based Jobs (D2.1), Intellectual Property & Innovation (D2.2), New Jobs in Creative Sectors (D2.3) and Human Capital & Education (D3.1) and, to a lesser extent, Openness, Tolerance & Trust (D3.2).\r\n",
      "In other words, fostering the local Creative economy seems to be an area to be addressed as a matter of priority, along with Tourism (underpinning D1.2).\r\n",
      "Table 3. Performance of European cities with attractiveness issues across the Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor’s nine policy dimensions\r\n",
      "Conclusions\r\n",
      "Based on the above analysis, common challenges, especially for cities with attractiveness issues, are mostly related to Tourism and the Creative Economy (especially as regards job creation). In addition, the Partnership identified other priority topics to be addressed and which cannot fully emerge from a quantitative analysis, namely:\r\n",
      "· How to best foster local Cultural Vibrancy?\r\n",
      "· Priority topics: a) Tourism, b) Transformation, adaptive reuse and urban reconversion\r\n",
      "· How to best enhance the local Creative Economy?\r\n",
      "· Priority topics: c) Cultural and Creative Industries\r\n",
      "· How to create an Enabling Environment helping culture and creativity to thrive?\r\n",
      "· Priority topics: d) Resilience of cultural and natural heritage, e) Financial sustainability, f) Integrated & interdisciplinary approaches for governance\n",
